summary: 'The Coherence library has "Mass Assignment"-like vulnerabilities. In particular,
  "registration"

  endpoints (like creating, editing, updating), allow users to update any coherence_fields.
  This

  means that, among other issues, users can automatically confirm their accounts by
  sending the

  confirmed_at parameter with their registration request. Further, the library design
  and

  documentation encourages insecure functionality by default.


  For example, the "store" demo allows registering users to add themselves as admin:
