severities: []
summary: 'Improper Input Validation

  An issue was discovered in the BSON ObjectID (aka `bson-objectid`). `ObjectID()`
  allows an attacker to generate a malformed objectid by inserting an additional property
  to the user-input, because bson-objectid will return early if it detects `_bsontype==ObjectID`
  in the user-input object. As a result, objects in arbitrary forms can bypass formatting
  if they have a valid bsontype.'
