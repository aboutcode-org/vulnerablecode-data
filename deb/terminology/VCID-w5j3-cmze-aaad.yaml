summary: Terminology before 1.3.1 allows Remote Code Execution because popmedia is
  mishandled, as demonstrated by an unsafe "cat README.md" command when \e}pn is used.
  A popmedia control sequence can allow the malicious execution of executable file
  formats registered in the X desktop share MIME types (/usr/share/applications).
  The control sequence defers unknown file types to the handle_unknown_media() function,
  which executes xdg-open against the filename specified in the sequence. The use
  of xdg-open for all unknown file types allows executable file formats with a registered
  shared MIME type to be executed. An attacker can achieve remote code execution by
  introducing an executable file and a plain text file containing the control sequence
  through a fake software project (e.g., in Git or a tarball). When the control sequence
  is rendered (such as with cat), the executable file will be run.
