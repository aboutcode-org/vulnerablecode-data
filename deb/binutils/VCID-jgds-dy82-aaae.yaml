summary: 'The ieee_object_p function in bfd/ieee.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD)
  library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, might allow remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly
  have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling
  of this file during "objdump -D" execution. NOTE: this may be related to a compiler
  bug.'
