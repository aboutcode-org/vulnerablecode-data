summary: The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in
  GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid read of size 1 because the existing
  reloc offset range tests didn't catch small negative offsets less than the size
  of the reloc field. This vulnerability causes programs that conduct an analysis
  of binary programs using the libbfd library, such as objdump, to crash.
