summary: There is an open race window when writing output in the following utilities
  in GNU binutils version 2.35 and earlier:ar, objcopy, strip, ranlib. When these
  utilities are run as a privileged user (presumably as part of a script updating
  binaries across different users), an unprivileged user can trick these utilities
  into getting ownership of arbitrary files through a symlink.
