summary: The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in
  GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid write of size 8 because of missing
  a malloc() return-value check to see if memory had actually been allocated in the
  _bfd_generic_get_section_contents function. This vulnerability causes programs that
  conduct an analysis of binary programs using the libbfd library, such as objcopy,
  to crash.
