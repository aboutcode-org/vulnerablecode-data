summary: The sh_elf_set_mach_from_flags function in bfd/elf32-sh.c in the Binary File
  Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash)
  or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated
  by mishandling of this file during "objdump -D" execution.
