summary: The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in
  GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to a global buffer over-read error because of an
  assumption made by code that runs for objcopy and strip, that SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections
  are always named starting with a .rel/.rela prefix. This vulnerability causes programs
  that conduct an analysis of binary programs using the libbfd library, such as objcopy
  and strip, to crash.
