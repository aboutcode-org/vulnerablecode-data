summary: The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in
  GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid read (of size 8) because of missing
  a check (in the copy_special_section_fields function) for an invalid sh_link field
  before attempting to follow it. This vulnerability causes Binutils utilities like
  strip to crash.
