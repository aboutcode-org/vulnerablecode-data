summary: The assign_file_positions_for_non_load_sections function in elf.c in the
  Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils
  2.30, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
  and application crash) via an ELF file with a RELRO segment that lacks a matching
  LOAD segment, as demonstrated by objcopy.
