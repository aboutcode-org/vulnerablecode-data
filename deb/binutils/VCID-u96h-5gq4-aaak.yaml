summary: An issue was discovered in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka
  libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. There is a heap-based buffer over-read
  in _bfd_doprnt in bfd.c because elf_object_p in elfcode.h mishandles an e_shstrndx
  section of type SHT_GROUP by omitting a trailing '\0' character.
