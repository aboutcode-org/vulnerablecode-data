summary: An issue was discovered in elf_link_input_bfd in elflink.c in the Binary
  File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31.
  There is a NULL pointer dereference in elf_link_input_bfd when used for finding
  STT_TLS symbols without any TLS section. A specially crafted ELF allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service, as demonstrated by ld.
