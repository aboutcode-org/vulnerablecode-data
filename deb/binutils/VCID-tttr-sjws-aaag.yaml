summary: The _bfd_XX_bfd_copy_private_bfd_data_common function in peXXigen.c in the
  Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils
  2.30, processes a negative Data Directory size with an unbounded loop that increases
  the value of (external_IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY) *edd so that the address exceeds its
  own memory region, resulting in an out-of-bounds memory write, as demonstrated by
  objcopy copying private info with _bfd_pex64_bfd_copy_private_bfd_data_common in
  pex64igen.c.
