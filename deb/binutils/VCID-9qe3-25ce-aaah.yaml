summary: The _bfd_elf_parse_gnu_properties function in elf-properties.c in the Binary
  File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29.1,
  does not prevent negative pointers, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via a crafted ELF file.
