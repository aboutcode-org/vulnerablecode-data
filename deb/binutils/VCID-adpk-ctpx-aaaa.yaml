summary: The bfd_cache_close function in bfd/cache.c in the Binary File Descriptor
  (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29 and earlier, allows
  remote attackers to cause a heap use after free and possibly achieve code execution
  via a crafted nested archive file. This issue occurs because incorrect functions
  are called during an attempt to release memory. The issue can be addressed by better
  input validation in the bfd_generic_archive_p function in bfd/archive.c.
