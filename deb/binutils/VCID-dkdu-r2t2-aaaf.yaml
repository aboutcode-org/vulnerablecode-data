summary: The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in
  GNU Binutils 2.29, does not validate the PLT section size, which allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash)
  via a crafted ELF file, related to elf_i386_get_synthetic_symtab in elf32-i386.c
  and elf_x86_64_get_synthetic_symtab in elf64-x86-64.c.
