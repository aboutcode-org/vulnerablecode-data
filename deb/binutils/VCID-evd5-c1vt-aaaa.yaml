summary: The elf_object_p function in elfcode.h in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD)
  library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, has an unsigned integer
  overflow because bfd_size_type multiplication is not used. A crafted ELF file allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have
  unspecified other impact.
