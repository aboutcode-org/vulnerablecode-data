summary: An issue was discovered in the merge_strings function in merge.c in the Binary
  File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31.
  There is a NULL pointer dereference in _bfd_add_merge_section when attempting to
  merge sections with large alignments. A specially crafted ELF allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service, as demonstrated by ld.
