summary: A heap-based buffer over-read issue was discovered in the function sec_merge_hash_lookup
  in merge.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed
  in GNU Binutils 2.31, because _bfd_add_merge_section mishandles section merges when
  size is not a multiple of entsize. A specially crafted ELF allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service, as demonstrated by ld.
