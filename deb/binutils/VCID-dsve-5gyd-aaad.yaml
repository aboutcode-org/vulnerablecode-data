summary: The get_build_id function in opncls.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD)
  library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash)
  via a crafted file in which a certain size field is larger than a corresponding
  data field, as demonstrated by mishandling within the objdump program.
