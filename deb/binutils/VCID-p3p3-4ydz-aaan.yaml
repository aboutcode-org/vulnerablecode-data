summary: The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in
  GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid read of size 8 because of missing
  a check to determine whether symbols are NULL in the _bfd_dwarf2_find_nearest_line
  function. This vulnerability causes programs that conduct an analysis of binary
  programs using the libbfd library, such as objdump, to crash.
