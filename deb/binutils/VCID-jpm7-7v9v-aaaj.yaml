summary: The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in
  GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid read of size 4 due to NULL pointer
  dereferencing of _bfd_elf_large_com_section. This vulnerability causes programs
  that conduct an analysis of binary programs using the libbfd library, such as objcopy,
  to crash.
