summary: The _bfd_coff_read_string_table function in coffgen.c in the Binary File
  Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, does
  not properly validate the size of the external string table, which allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (excessive memory consumption, or heap-based
  buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact
  via a crafted COFF binary.
