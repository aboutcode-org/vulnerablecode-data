summary: bfd/vms-alpha.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd),
  as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other
  impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file in
  the _bfd_vms_get_value and _bfd_vms_slurp_etir functions during "objdump -D" execution.
