severities: []
summary: It's been found that multiple functions in ipmitool before 1.8.19 neglect
  proper checking of the data received from a remote LAN party, which may lead to
  buffer overflows and potentially to remote code execution on the ipmitool side.
  This is especially dangerous if ipmitool is run as a privileged user. This problem
  is fixed in version 1.8.19.
