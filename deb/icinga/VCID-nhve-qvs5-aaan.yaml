summary: Icinga Core through 1.14.0 initially executes bin/icinga as root but supports
  configuration options in which this file is owned by a non-root account (and similarly
  can have etc/icinga.cfg owned by a non-root account), which allows local users to
  gain privileges by leveraging access to this non-root account, a related issue to
  CVE-2017-14312. This also affects bin/icingastats, bin/ido2db, and bin/log2ido.
