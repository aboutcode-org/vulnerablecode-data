summary: The get_option function in dhcp.c in dhcpcd before 6.2.0, as used in dhcpcd
  5.x in Android before 5.1 and other products, does not validate the relationship
  between length fields and the amount of data, which allows remote DHCP servers to
  execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a large
  length value of an option in a DHCPACK message.
