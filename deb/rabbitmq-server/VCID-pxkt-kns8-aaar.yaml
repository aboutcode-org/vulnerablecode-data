severities: []
summary: Pivotal RabbitMQ for PCF, all versions, uses a deterministically generated
  cookie that is shared between all machines when configured in a multi-tenant cluster.
  A remote attacker who can gain information about the network topology can guess
  this cookie and, if they have access to the right ports on any server in the MQ
  cluster can use this cookie to gain full control over the entire cluster.
