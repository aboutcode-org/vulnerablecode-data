severities: []
summary: RabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging broker. In rabbitmq-server prior to
  version 3.8.18, when a federation link was displayed in the RabbitMQ management
  UI via the `rabbitmq_federation_management` plugin, its consumer tag was rendered
  without proper <script> tag sanitization. This potentially allows for JavaScript
  code execution in the context of the page. The user must be signed in and have elevated
  permissions (manage federation upstreams and policies) for this to occur. The vulnerability
  is patched in RabbitMQ 3.8.18. As a workaround, disable the `rabbitmq_federation_management`
  plugin and use [CLI tools](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html) instead.
