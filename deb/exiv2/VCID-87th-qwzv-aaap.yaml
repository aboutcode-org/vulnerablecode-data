severities: []
summary: Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting,
  and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2
  versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is
  used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially
  exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they
  can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this
  bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used
  Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the
  Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such
  as insert. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.
