severities: []
summary: Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting,
  and modifying the metadata of image files. An infinite loop is triggered when Exiv2
  is used to read the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially
  exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim
  into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5.
