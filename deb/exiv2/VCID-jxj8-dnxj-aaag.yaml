severities: []
summary: Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete
  and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. A read of uninitialized memory
  was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. Exiv2 is a command-line utility
  and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image
  files. The read of uninitialized memory is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read
  the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
  vulnerability to leak a few bytes of stack memory, if they can trick the victim
  into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.
