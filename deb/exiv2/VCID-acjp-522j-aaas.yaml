summary: Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting,
  and modifying the metadata of image files. An infinite loop was found in Exiv2 versions
  v0.27.4 and earlier. The infinite loop is triggered when Exiv2 is used to modify
  the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
  vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running
  Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when deleting
  the IPTC data, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation that requires an
  extra command line option (`-d I rm`). The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5.
