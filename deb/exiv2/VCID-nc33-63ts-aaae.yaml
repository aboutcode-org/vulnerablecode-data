summary: Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting,
  and modifying the metadata of image files. A null pointer dereference was found
  in Exiv2 versions v0.27.4 and earlier. The null pointer dereference is triggered
  when Exiv2 is used to print the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could
  potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can
  trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug
  is only triggered when printing the interpreted (translated) data, which is a less
  frequently used Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command line option (`-p
  t` or `-P t`). The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5.
