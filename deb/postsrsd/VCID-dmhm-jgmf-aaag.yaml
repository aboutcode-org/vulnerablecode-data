summary: 'PostSRSd before 1.11 allows a denial of service (subprocess hang) if Postfix
  sends certain long data fields such as multiple concatenated email addresses. NOTE:
  the PostSRSd maintainer acknowledges "theoretically, this error should never occur
  ... I''m not sure if there''s a reliable way to trigger this condition by an external
  attacker, but it is a security bug in PostSRSd nevertheless."'
