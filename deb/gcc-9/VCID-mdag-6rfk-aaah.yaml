summary: The POWER9 backend in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) before version 10 could
  optimize multiple calls of the __builtin_darn intrinsic into a single call, thus
  reducing the entropy of the random number generator. This occurred because a volatile
  operation was not specified. For example, within a single execution of a program,
  the output of every __builtin_darn() call may be the same.
