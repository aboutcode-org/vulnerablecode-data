severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4. Due to
  incorrect data validation, HTTP Request Smuggling attacks may succeed against HTTP
  and HTTPS traffic. This leads to cache poisoning. This allows any client, including
  browser scripts, to bypass local security and poison the proxy cache and any downstream
  caches with content from an arbitrary source. When configured for relaxed header
  parsing (the default), Squid relays headers containing whitespace characters to
  upstream servers. When this occurs as a prefix to a Content-Length header, the frame
  length specified will be ignored by Squid (allowing for a conflicting length to
  be used from another Content-Length header) but relayed upstream.
