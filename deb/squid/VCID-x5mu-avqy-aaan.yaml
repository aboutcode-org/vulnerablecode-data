summary: 'An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4. Due to
  incorrect data validation, HTTP Request Splitting attacks may succeed against HTTP
  and HTTPS traffic. This leads to cache poisoning. This allows any client, including
  browser scripts, to bypass local security and poison the browser cache and any downstream
  caches with content from an arbitrary source. Squid uses a string search instead
  of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header to find chunked encoding. This allows an
  attacker to hide a second request inside Transfer-Encoding: it is interpreted by
  Squid as chunked and split out into a second request delivered upstream. Squid will
  then deliver two distinct responses to the client, corrupting any downstream caches.'
