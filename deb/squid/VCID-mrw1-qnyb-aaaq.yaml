summary: An issue was discovered in Squid 3.3.9 through 3.5.28 and 4.x through 4.7.
  When Squid is configured to use Digest authentication, it parses the header Proxy-Authorization.
  It searches for certain tokens such as domain, uri, and qop. Squid checks if this
  token's value starts with a quote and ends with one. If so, it performs a memcpy
  of its length minus 2. Squid never checks whether the value is just a single quote
  (which would satisfy its requirements), leading to a memcpy of its length minus
  1.
