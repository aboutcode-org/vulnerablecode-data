summary: An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8 when the append_domain
  setting is used (because the appended characters do not properly interact with hostname
  length restrictions). Due to incorrect message processing, it can inappropriately
  redirect traffic to origins it should not be delivered to.
