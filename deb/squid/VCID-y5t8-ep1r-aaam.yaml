summary: An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When handling requests from
  users, Squid checks its rules to see if the request should be denied. Squid by default
  comes with rules to block access to the Cache Manager, which serves detailed server
  information meant for the maintainer. This rule is implemented via url_regex. The
  handler for url_regex rules URL decodes an incoming request. This allows an attacker
  to encode their URL to bypass the url_regex check, and gain access to the blocked
  resource.
