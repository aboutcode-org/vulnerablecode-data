summary: An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8. Due to incorrect
  input validation, there is a heap-based buffer overflow that can result in Denial
  of Service to all clients using the proxy. Severity is high due to this vulnerability
  occurring before normal security checks; any remote client that can reach the proxy
  port can trivially perform the attack via a crafted URI scheme.
