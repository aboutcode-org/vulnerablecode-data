summary: An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8. It allows attackers
  to smuggle HTTP requests through frontend software to a Squid instance that splits
  the HTTP Request pipeline differently. The resulting Response messages corrupt caches
  (between a client and Squid) with attacker-controlled content at arbitrary URLs.
  Effects are isolated to software between the attacker client and Squid. There are
  no effects on Squid itself, nor on any upstream servers. The issue is related to
  a request header containing whitespace between a header name and a colon.
