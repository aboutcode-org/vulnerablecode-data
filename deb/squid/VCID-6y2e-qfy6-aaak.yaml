summary: An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.9. URN response handling in Squid
  suffers from a heap-based buffer overflow. When receiving data from a remote server
  in response to an URN request, Squid fails to ensure that the response can fit within
  the buffer. This leads to attacker controlled data overflowing in the heap.
