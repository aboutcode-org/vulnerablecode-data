summary: An issue was discovered in Squid before 5.0.2. A remote attacker can replay
  a sniffed Digest Authentication nonce to gain access to resources that are otherwise
  forbidden. This occurs because the attacker can overflow the nonce reference counter
  (a short integer). Remote code execution may occur if the pooled token credentials
  are freed (instead of replayed as valid credentials).
