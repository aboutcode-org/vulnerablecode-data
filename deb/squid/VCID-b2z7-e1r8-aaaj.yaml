summary: An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When handling the tag esi:when
  when ESI is enabled, Squid calls ESIExpression::Evaluate. This function uses a fixed
  stack buffer to hold the expression while it's being evaluated. When processing
  the expression, it could either evaluate the top of the stack, or add a new member
  to the stack. When adding a new member, there is no check to ensure that the stack
  won't overflow.
