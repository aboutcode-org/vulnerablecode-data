severities: []
summary: Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4 allows a trusted peer to perform Denial
  of Service by consuming all available CPU cycles during handling of a crafted Cache
  Digest response message. This only occurs when cache_peer is used with the cache
  digests feature. The problem exists because peerDigestHandleReply() livelocking
  in peer_digest.cc mishandles EOF.
