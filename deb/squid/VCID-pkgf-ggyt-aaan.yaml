summary: An issue was discovered in Squid 4.0.23 through 4.7. When checking Basic
  Authentication with HttpHeader::getAuth, Squid uses a global buffer to store the
  decoded data. Squid does not check that the decoded length isn't greater than the
  buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow with user controlled data.
