summary: An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.9. When handling a URN request,
  a corresponding HTTP request is made. This HTTP request doesn't go through the access
  checks that incoming HTTP requests go through. This causes all access checks to
  be bypassed and allows access to restricted HTTP servers, e.g., an attacker can
  connect to HTTP servers that only listen on localhost.
