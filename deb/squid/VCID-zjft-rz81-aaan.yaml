summary: An issue was discovered in Squid 2.x through 2.7.STABLE9, 3.x through 3.5.28,
  and 4.x through 4.7. When Squid is configured to use Basic Authentication, the Proxy-Authorization
  header is parsed via uudecode. uudecode determines how many bytes will be decoded
  by iterating over the input and checking its table. The length is then used to start
  decoding the string. There are no checks to ensure that the length it calculates
  isn't greater than the input buffer. This leads to adjacent memory being decoded
  as well. An attacker would not be able to retrieve the decoded data unless the Squid
  maintainer had configured the display of usernames on error pages.
