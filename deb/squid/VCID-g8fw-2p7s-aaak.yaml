summary: 'An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to
  a buffer-management bug, it allows a denial of service. When resolving a request
  with the urn: scheme, the parser leaks a small amount of memory. However, there
  is an unspecified attack methodology that can easily trigger a large amount of memory
  consumption.'
