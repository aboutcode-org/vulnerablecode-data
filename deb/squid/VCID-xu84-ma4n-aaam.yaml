summary: An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.12 and 5.x before 5.0.3. Due to
  use of a potentially dangerous function, Squid and the default certificate validation
  helper are vulnerable to a Denial of Service when opening a TLS connection to an
  attacker-controlled server for HTTPS. This occurs because unrecognized error values
  are mapped to NULL, but later code expects that each error value is mapped to a
  valid error string.
