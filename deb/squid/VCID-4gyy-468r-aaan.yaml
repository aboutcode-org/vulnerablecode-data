summary: An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When Squid is parsing ESI,
  it keeps the ESI elements in ESIContext. ESIContext contains a buffer for holding
  a stack of ESIElements. When a new ESIElement is parsed, it is added via addStackElement.
  addStackElement has a check for the number of elements in this buffer, but it's
  off by 1, leading to a Heap Overflow of 1 element. The overflow is within the same
  structure so it can't affect adjacent memory blocks, and thus just leads to a crash
  while processing.
