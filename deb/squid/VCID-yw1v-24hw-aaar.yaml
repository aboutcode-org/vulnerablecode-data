summary: An issue was discovered in Squid 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x through 4.8. Due to incorrect
  data management, it is vulnerable to information disclosure when processing HTTP
  Digest Authentication. Nonce tokens contain the raw byte value of a pointer that
  sits within heap memory allocation. This information reduces ASLR protections and
  may aid attackers isolating memory areas to target for remote code execution attacks.
