severities: []
summary: fcgid_spawn_ctl.c in the mod_fcgid module 2.3.6 for the Apache HTTP Server
  does not recognize the FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass directive for a virtual host, which
  makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption)
  via a series of HTTP requests that triggers a process count higher than the intended
  limit.
