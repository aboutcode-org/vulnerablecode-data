severities: []
summary: Through a malicious URL that contained a quote character it was possible
  to inject HTML code in KMail's plaintext viewer. Due to the parser used on the URL
  it was not possible to include the equal sign (=) or a space into the injected HTML,
  which greatly reduces the available HTML functionality. Although it is possible
  to include an HTML comment indicator to hide content.
