severities: []
summary: RealVNC 4.1.1, and other products that use RealVNC such as AdderLink IP and
  Cisco CallManager, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a request
  in which the client specifies an insecure security type such as "Type 1 - None",
  which is accepted even if it is not offered by the server, as originally demonstrated
  using a long password.
