severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in IPA, all 4.6.x versions before 4.6.7, all 4.7.x versions
  before 4.7.4 and all 4.8.x versions before 4.8.3, in the way that FreeIPA's batch
  processing API logged operations. This included passing user passwords in clear
  text on FreeIPA masters. Batch processing of commands with passwords as arguments
  or options is not performed by default in FreeIPA but is possible by third-party
  components. An attacker having access to system logs on FreeIPA masters could use
  this flaw to produce log file content with passwords exposed.
