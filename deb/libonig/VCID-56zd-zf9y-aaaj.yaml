severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby
  through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-bounds write or read
  occurs in next_state_val() during regular expression compilation. Octal numbers
  larger than 0xff are not handled correctly in fetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc().
  A malformed regular expression containing an octal number in the form of '\700'
  would produce an invalid code point value larger than 0xff in next_state_val(),
  resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption.
