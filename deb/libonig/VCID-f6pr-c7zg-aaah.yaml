summary: An integer overflow in the search_in_range function in regexec.c in Oniguruma
  6.x before 6.9.4_rc2 leads to an out-of-bounds read, in which the offset of this
  read is under the control of an attacker. (This only affects the 32-bit compiled
  version). Remote attackers can cause a denial-of-service or information disclosure,
  or possibly have unspecified other impact, via a crafted regular expression.
