severities: []
summary: dnscache in Daniel J. Bernstein djbdns 1.05 does not prevent simultaneous
  identical outbound DNS queries, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof
  DNS responses, as demonstrated by a spoofed A record in the Additional section of
  a response to a Start of Authority (SOA) query.
