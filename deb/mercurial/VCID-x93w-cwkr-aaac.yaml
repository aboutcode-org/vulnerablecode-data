summary: In Mercurial before 4.4.1, it is possible that a specially malformed repository
  can cause Git subrepositories to run arbitrary code in the form of a .git/hooks/post-update
  script checked into the repository. Typical use of Mercurial prevents construction
  of such repositories, but they can be created programmatically.
