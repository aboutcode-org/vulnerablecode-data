severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in podman. The `podman machine` function (used to create
  and manage Podman virtual machine containing a Podman process) spawns a `gvproxy`
  process on the host system. The `gvproxy` API is accessible on port 7777 on all
  IP addresses on the host. If that port is open on the host's firewall, an attacker
  can potentially use the `gvproxy` API to forward ports on the host to ports in the
  VM, making private services on the VM accessible to the network. This issue could
  be also used to interrupt the host's services by forwarding all ports to the VM.
