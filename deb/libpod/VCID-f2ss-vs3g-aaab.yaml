summary: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users
  running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused
  by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container,
  even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly
  escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security
  features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability
  is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
