summary: An issue was discovered in Podman in libpod before 1.6.0. It resolves a symlink
  in the host context during a copy operation from the container to the host, because
  an undesired glob operation occurs. An attacker could create a container image containing
  particular symlinks that, when copied by a victim user to the host filesystem, may
  overwrite existing files with others from the host.
