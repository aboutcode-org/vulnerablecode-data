summary: libspf2 before 1.2.11 has a heap-based buffer overflow that might allow remote
  attackers to execute arbitrary code (via an unauthenticated e-mail message from
  anywhere on the Internet) with a crafted SPF DNS record, because of SPF_record_expand_data
  in spf_expand.c. The amount of overflowed data depends on the relationship between
  the length of an entire domain name and the length of its leftmost label. The vulnerable
  code may be part of the supply chain of a site's e-mail infrastructure (e.g., with
  additional configuration, Exim can use libspf2; the Postfix web site links to unofficial
  patches for use of libspf2 with Postfix; older versions of spfquery relied on libspf2)
  but most often is not.
