severities: []
summary: A buffer overflow in the fribidi_get_par_embedding_levels_ex() function in
  lib/fribidi-bidi.c of GNU FriBidi through 1.0.7 allows an attacker to cause a denial
  of service or possibly execute arbitrary code by delivering crafted text content
  to a user, when this content is then rendered by an application that uses FriBidi
  for text layout calculations. Examples include any GNOME or GTK+ based application
  that uses Pango for text layout, as this internally uses FriBidi for bidirectional
  text layout. For example, the attacker can construct a crafted text file to be opened
  in GEdit, or a crafted IRC message to be viewed in HexChat.
