severities: []
summary: Dibbler 0.6.0 does not verify that certain length parameters are appropriate
  for buffer sizes, which allows remote attackers to trigger a buffer over-read and
  cause a denial of service (daemon crash), as demonstrated by incorrect behavior
  of the TSrvMsg constructor in SrvMessages/SrvMsg.cpp when (1) reading the option
  code and option length and (2) parsing options.
