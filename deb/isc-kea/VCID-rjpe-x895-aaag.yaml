severities: []
summary: 'A missing check on incoming client requests can be exploited to cause a
  situation where the Kea server''s lease storage contains leases which are rejected
  as invalid when the server tries to load leases from storage on restart. If the
  number of such leases exceeds a hard-coded limit in the Kea code, a server trying
  to restart will conclude that there is a problem with its lease store and give up.
  Versions affected: 1.4.0 to 1.5.0, 1.6.0-beta1, and 1.6.0-beta2'
