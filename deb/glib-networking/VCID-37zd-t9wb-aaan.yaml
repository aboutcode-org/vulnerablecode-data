severities: []
summary: In GNOME glib-networking through 2.64.2, the implementation of GTlsClientConnection
  skips hostname verification of the server's TLS certificate if the application fails
  to specify the expected server identity. This is in contrast to its intended documented
  behavior, to fail the certificate verification. Applications that fail to provide
  the server identity, including Balsa before 2.5.11 and 2.6.x before 2.6.1, accept
  a TLS certificate if the certificate is valid for any host.
