summary: libcurl versions from 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0 is vulnerable to a heap buffer
  out-of-bounds read. The function handling incoming NTLM type-2 messages (`lib/vauth/ntlm.c:ntlm_decode_type2_target`)
  does not validate incoming data correctly and is subject to an integer overflow
  vulnerability. Using that overflow, a malicious or broken NTLM server could trick
  libcurl to accept a bad length + offset combination that would lead to a buffer
  read out-of-bounds.
