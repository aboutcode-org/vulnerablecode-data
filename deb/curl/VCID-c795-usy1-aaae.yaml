summary: When curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 connects to an IMAP or POP3 server to retrieve
  data using STARTTLS to upgrade to TLS security, the server can respond and send
  back multiple responses at once that curl caches. curl would then upgrade to TLS
  but not flush the in-queue of cached responses but instead continue using and trustingthe
  responses it got *before* the TLS handshake as if they were authenticated.Using
  this flaw, it allows a Man-In-The-Middle attacker to first inject the fake responses,
  then pass-through the TLS traffic from the legitimate server and trick curl into
  sending data back to the user thinking the attacker's injected data comes from the
  TLS-protected server.
