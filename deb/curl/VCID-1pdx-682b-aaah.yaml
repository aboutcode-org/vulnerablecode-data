summary: curl before version 7.51.0 doesn't parse the authority component of the URL
  correctly when the host name part ends with a '#' character, and could instead be
  tricked into connecting to a different host. This may have security implications
  if you for example use an URL parser that follows the RFC to check for allowed domains
  before using curl to request them.
