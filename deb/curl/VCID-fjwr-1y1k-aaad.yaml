summary: When curl is instructed to download content using the metalink feature, thecontents
  is verified against a hash provided in the metalink XML file.The metalink XML file
  points out to the client how to get the same contentfrom a set of different URLs,
  potentially hosted by different servers and theclient can then download the file
  from one or several of them. In a serial orparallel manner.If one of the servers
  hosting the contents has been breached and the contentsof the specific file on that
  server is replaced with a modified payload, curlshould detect this when the hash
  of the file mismatches after a completeddownload. It should remove the contents
  and instead try getting the contentsfrom another URL. This is not done, and instead
  such a hash mismatch is onlymentioned in text and the potentially malicious content
  is kept in the file ondisk.
