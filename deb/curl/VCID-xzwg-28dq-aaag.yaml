summary: The verify_certificate function in lib/vtls/schannel.c in libcurl 7.30.0
  through 7.51.0, when built for Windows CE using the schannel TLS backend, allows
  remote attackers to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service (crash),
  or possibly have unspecified other impact via a wildcard certificate name, which
  triggers an out-of-bounds read.
