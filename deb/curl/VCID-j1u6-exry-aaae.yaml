severities: []
summary: curl before version 7.61.1 is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the NTLM
  authentication code. The internal function Curl_ntlm_core_mk_nt_hash multiplies
  the length of the password by two (SUM) to figure out how large temporary storage
  area to allocate from the heap. The length value is then subsequently used to iterate
  over the password and generate output into the allocated storage buffer. On systems
  with a 32 bit size_t, the math to calculate SUM triggers an integer overflow when
  the password length exceeds 2GB (2^31 bytes). This integer overflow usually causes
  a very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge
  one, making the use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow. (This bug is
  almost identical to CVE-2017-8816.)
