summary: curl before 7.53.0 has an incorrect TLS Certificate Status Request extension
  feature that asks for a fresh proof of the server's certificate's validity in the
  code that checks for a test success or failure. It ends up always thinking there's
  valid proof, even when there is none or if the server doesn't support the TLS extension
  in question. This could lead to users not detecting when a server's certificate
  goes invalid or otherwise be mislead that the server is in a better shape than it
  is in reality. This flaw also exists in the command line tool (--cert-status).
