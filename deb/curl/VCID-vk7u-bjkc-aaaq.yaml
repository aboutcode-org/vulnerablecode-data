summary: cURL and libcurl 7.40.0 through 7.42.1 send the HTTP Basic authentication
  credentials for a previous connection when reusing a reset (curl_easy_reset) connection
  handle to send a request to the same host name, which allows remote attackers to
  obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors.
