summary: curl supports the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS`in
  libcurl. This rarely used option is used to send variable=content pairs toTELNET
  servers.Due to flaw in the option parser for sending `NEW_ENV` variables, libcurlcould
  be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to theserver. Therefore
  potentially revealing sensitive internal information to theserver using a clear-text
  network protocol.This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly
  whenparsing the string provided by the application.
