severities: []
summary: The ourWriteOut function in tool_writeout.c in curl 7.53.1 might allow physically
  proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory in opportunistic
  circumstances by reading a workstation screen during use of a --write-out argument
  ending in a '%' character, which leads to a heap-based buffer over-read.
