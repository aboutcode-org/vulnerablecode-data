summary: curl, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 before version 7.19.7-53,
  did not correctly backport the fix for CVE-2015-3148 because it did not reflect
  the fact that the HAVE_GSSAPI define was meanwhile substituted by USE_HTTP_NEGOTIATE.
  This issue was introduced in RHEL 6.7 and affects RHEL 6 curl only.
