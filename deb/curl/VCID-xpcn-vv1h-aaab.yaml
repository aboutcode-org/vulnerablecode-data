severities: []
summary: cURL and libcurl 7.1 before 7.36.0, when using the OpenSSL, axtls, qsossl
  or gskit libraries for TLS, recognize a wildcard IP address in the subject's Common
  Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which might allow man-in-the-middle attackers
  to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate
  Certification Authority.
