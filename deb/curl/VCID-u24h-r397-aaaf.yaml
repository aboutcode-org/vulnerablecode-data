severities: []
summary: A malicious server can use the FTP PASV response to trick curl 7.73.0 and
  earlier into connecting back to a given IP address and port, and this way potentially
  make curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not
  disclosed, for example doing port scanning and service banner extractions.
