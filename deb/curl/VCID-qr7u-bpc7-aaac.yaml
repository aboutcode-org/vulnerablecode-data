summary: An IMAP FETCH response line indicates the size of the returned data, in number
  of bytes. When that response says the data is zero bytes, libcurl would pass on
  that (non-existing) data with a pointer and the size (zero) to the deliver-data
  function. libcurl's deliver-data function treats zero as a magic number and invokes
  strlen() on the data to figure out the length. The strlen() is called on a heap
  based buffer that might not be zero terminated so libcurl might read beyond the
  end of it into whatever memory lies after (or just crash) and then deliver that
  to the application as if it was actually downloaded.
