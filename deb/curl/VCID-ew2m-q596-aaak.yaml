severities: []
summary: curl and libcurl before 7.50.2, when built with NSS and the libnsspem.so
  library is available at runtime, allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication
  of a TLS connection by leveraging reuse of a previously loaded client certificate
  from file for a connection for which no certificate has been set, a different vulnerability
  than CVE-2016-5420.
