summary: A heap use-after-free flaw was found in curl versions from 7.59.0 through
  7.61.1 in the code related to closing an easy handle. When closing and cleaning
  up an 'easy' handle in the `Curl_close()` function, the library code first frees
  a struct (without nulling the pointer) and might then subsequently erroneously write
  to a struct field within that already freed struct.
