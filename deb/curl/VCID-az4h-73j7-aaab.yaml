severities: []
summary: curl 7.7 through 7.76.1 suffers from an information disclosure when the `-t`
  command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl, is used to send
  variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to a flaw in the option parser for
  sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from
  a stack based buffer to the server, resulting in potentially revealing sensitive
  internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol.
