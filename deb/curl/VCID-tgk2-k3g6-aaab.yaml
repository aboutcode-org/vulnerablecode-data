summary: A non-privileged user or program can put code and a config file in a known
  non-privileged path (under C:/usr/local/) that will make curl <= 7.65.1 automatically
  run the code (as an openssl "engine") on invocation. If that curl is invoked by
  a privileged user it can do anything it wants.
