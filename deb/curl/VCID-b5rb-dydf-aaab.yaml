summary: libcurl versions from 7.34.0 to before 7.64.0 are vulnerable to a heap out-of-bounds
  read in the code handling the end-of-response for SMTP. If the buffer passed to
  `smtp_endofresp()` isn't NUL terminated and contains no character ending the parsed
  number, and `len` is set to 5, then the `strtol()` call reads beyond the allocated
  buffer. The read contents will not be returned to the caller.
