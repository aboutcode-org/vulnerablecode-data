summary: The sanitize_cookie_path function in cURL and libcurl 7.31.0 through 7.41.0
  does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact
  via a cookie path containing only a double-quote character.
