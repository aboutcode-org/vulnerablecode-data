summary: A flaw was found in curl before version 7.51.0 When re-using a connection,
  curl was doing case insensitive comparisons of user name and password with the existing
  connections. This means that if an unused connection with proper credentials exists
  for a protocol that has connection-scoped credentials, an attacker can cause that
  connection to be reused if s/he knows the case-insensitive version of the correct
  password.
