severities: []
summary: A user can tell curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 to require a successful upgrade
  to TLS when speaking to an IMAP, POP3 or FTP server (`--ssl-reqd` on the command
  line or`CURLOPT_USE_SSL` set to `CURLUSESSL_CONTROL` or `CURLUSESSL_ALL` withlibcurl).
  This requirement could be bypassed if the server would return a properly crafted
  but perfectly legitimate response.This flaw would then make curl silently continue
  its operations **withoutTLS** contrary to the instructions and expectations, exposing
  possibly sensitive data in clear text over the network.
