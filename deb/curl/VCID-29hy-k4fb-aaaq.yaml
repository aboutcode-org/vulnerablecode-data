summary: 'libcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0 contains an out bounds read in code
  handling HTTP/2 trailers. It was reported (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231)
  that reading an HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size
  was one byte less than required. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like
  headers from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `:` to the target
  buffer, while this was recently changed to `: ` (a space was added after the colon)
  but the following math wasn''t updated correspondingly. When accessed, the data
  is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large) data gets
  passed to client write. This could lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information
  disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.'
