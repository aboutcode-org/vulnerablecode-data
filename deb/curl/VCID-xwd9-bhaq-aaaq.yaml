summary: libcurl 7.1 through 7.57.0 might accidentally leak authentication data to
  third parties. When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP requests, libcurl will
  send that set of headers first to the host in the initial URL but also, if asked
  to follow redirects and a 30X HTTP response code is returned, to the host mentioned
  in URL in the `Location:` response header value. Sending the same set of headers
  to subsequent hosts is in particular a problem for applications that pass on custom
  `Authorization:` headers, as this header often contains privacy sensitive information
  or data that could allow others to impersonate the libcurl-using client's request.
