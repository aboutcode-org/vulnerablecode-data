severities: []
summary: curl supports "globbing" of URLs, in which a user can pass a numerical range
  to have the tool iterate over those numbers to do a sequence of transfers. In the
  globbing function that parses the numerical range, there was an omission that made
  curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL if given a carefully crafted, or just
  wrongly written, URL. The URL is stored in a heap based buffer, so it could then
  be made to wrongly read something else instead of crashing. An example of a URL
  that triggers the flaw would be `http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`.
