summary: vzctl before 4.9.4 determines the virtual environment (VE) layout based on
  the presence of root.hdd/DiskDescriptor.xml in the VE private directory, which allows
  local simfs container (CT) root users to change the root password for arbitrary
  ploop containers, as demonstrated by a symlink attack on the ploop container root.hdd
  file and then access a control panel.
