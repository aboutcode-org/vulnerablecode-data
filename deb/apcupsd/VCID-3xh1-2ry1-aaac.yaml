summary: In Adam Kropelin adk0212 APC UPS Daemon through 3.14.14, the default installation
  of APCUPSD allows a local authenticated, but unprivileged, user to run arbitrary
  code with elevated privileges by replacing the service executable apcupsd.exe with
  a malicious executable that will run with SYSTEM privileges at startup. This occurs
  because of "RW NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users" permissions for %SYSTEMDRIVE%\apcupsd\bin\apcupsd.exe.
