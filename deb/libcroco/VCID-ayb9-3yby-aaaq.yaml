summary: '** DISPUTED ** The cr_tknzr_parse_rgb function in cr-tknzr.c in libcroco
  0.6.11 and 0.6.12 has an "outside the range of representable values of type long"
  undefined behavior issue, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
  CSS file. NOTE: third-party analysis reports "This is not a security issue in my
  view. The conversion surely is truncating the double into a long value, but there
  is no impact as the value is one of the RGB components."'
