summary: In KDE KMail 5.2.3, an attacker in possession of S/MIME or PGP encrypted
  emails can wrap them as sub-parts within a crafted multipart email. The encrypted
  part(s) can further be hidden using HTML/CSS or ASCII newline characters. This modified
  multipart email can be re-sent by the attacker to the intended receiver. If the
  receiver replies to this (benign looking) email, they unknowingly leak the plaintext
  of the encrypted message part(s) back to the attacker.
