summary: Apache Tomcat Native 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.1.23 to 1.1.34 has a flaw that
  does not properly check OCSP pre-produced responses, which are lists (multiple entries)
  of certificate statuses. Subsequently, revoked client certificates may not be properly
  identified, allowing for users to authenticate with revoked certificates to connections
  that require mutual TLS. Users not using OCSP checks are not affected by this vulnerability.
