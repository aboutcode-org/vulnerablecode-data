summary: When parsing the AIA-Extension field of a client certificate, Apache Tomcat
  Native Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.1.23 to 1.1.34 did not correctly handle fields
  longer than 127 bytes. The result of the parsing error was to skip the OCSP check.
  It was therefore possible for client certificates that should have been rejected
  (if the OCSP check had been made) to be accepted. Users not using OCSP checks are
  not affected by this vulnerability.
