summary: When using an OCSP responder Apache Tomcat Native 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.1.23
  to 1.1.34 did not correctly handle invalid responses. This allowed for revoked client
  certificates to be incorrectly identified. It was therefore possible for users to
  authenticate with revoked certificates when using mutual TLS. Users not using OCSP
  checks are not affected by this vulnerability.
