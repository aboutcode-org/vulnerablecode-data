summary: In Zabbix from 4.0.x before 4.0.28rc1, 5.0.0alpha1 before 5.0.10rc1, 5.2.x
  before 5.2.6rc1, and 5.4.0alpha1 before 5.4.0beta2, the CControllerAuthenticationUpdate
  controller lacks a CSRF protection mechanism. The code inside this controller calls
  diableSIDValidation inside the init() method. An attacker doesn't have to know Zabbix
  user login credentials, but has to know the correct Zabbix URL and contact information
  of an existing user with sufficient privileges.
