summary: An issue was discovered in LinuxTV xawtv before 3.107. The function dev_open()
  in v4l-conf.c does not perform sufficient checks to prevent an unprivileged caller
  of the program from opening unintended filesystem paths. This allows a local attacker
  with access to the v4l-conf setuid-root program to test for the existence of arbitrary
  files and to trigger an open on arbitrary files with mode O_RDWR. To achieve this,
  relative path components need to be added to the device path, as demonstrated by
  a v4l-conf -c /dev/../root/.bash_history command.
