summary: 'libuser before 0.56.13-8 and 0.60 before 0.60-7, as used in the userhelper
  program in the usermode package, directly modifies /etc/passwd, which allows local
  users to cause a denial of service (inconsistent file state) by causing an error
  during the modification. NOTE: this issue can be combined with CVE-2015-3245 to
  gain privileges.'
