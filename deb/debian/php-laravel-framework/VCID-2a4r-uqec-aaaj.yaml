vulnerability_id: VCID-2a4r-uqec-aaaj
aliases:
  - CVE-2018-15133
summary: In Laravel Framework through 5.5.40 and 5.6.x through 5.6.29, remote code execution
  might occur as a result of an unserialize call on a potentially untrusted X-XSRF-TOKEN value.
  This involves the decrypt method in Illuminate/Encryption/Encrypter.php and PendingBroadcast
  in gadgetchains/Laravel/RCE/3/chain.php in phpggc. The attacker must know the application
  key, which normally would never occur, but could happen if the attacker previously had privileged
  access or successfully accomplished a previous attack.
