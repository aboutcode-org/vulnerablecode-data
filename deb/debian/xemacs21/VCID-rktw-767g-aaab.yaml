vulnerability_id: VCID-rktw-767g-aaab
aliases:
  - CVE-2022-45939
summary: GNU Emacs through 28.2 allows attackers to execute commands via shell metacharacters
  in the name of a source-code file, because lib-src/etags.c uses the system C library function
  in its implementation of the ctags program. For example, a victim may use the "ctags *" command
  (suggested in the ctags documentation) in a situation where the current working directory
  has contents that depend on untrusted input.
