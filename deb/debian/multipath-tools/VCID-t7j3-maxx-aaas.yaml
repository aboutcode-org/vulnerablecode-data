aliases:
  - CVE-2022-41973
summary: multipath-tools 0.7.7 through 0.9.x before 0.9.2 allows local users to obtain root
  access, as exploited in conjunction with CVE-2022-41974. Local users able to access /dev/shm
  can change symlinks in multipathd due to incorrect symlink handling, which could lead to controlled
  file writes outside of the /dev/shm directory. This could be used indirectly for local privilege
  escalation to root.
