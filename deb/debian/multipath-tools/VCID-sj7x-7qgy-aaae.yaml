vulnerability_id: VCID-sj7x-7qgy-aaae
aliases:
  - CVE-2022-41974
summary: multipath-tools 0.7.0 through 0.9.x before 0.9.2 allows local users to obtain root
  access, as exploited alone or in conjunction with CVE-2022-41973. Local users able to write
  to UNIX domain sockets can bypass access controls and manipulate the multipath setup. This
  can lead to local privilege escalation to root. This occurs because an attacker can repeat
  a keyword, which is mishandled because arithmetic ADD is used instead of bitwise OR.
