  - CVE-2022-23639
summary: crossbeam-utils provides atomics, synchronization primitives, scoped threads, and other
  utilities for concurrent programming in Rust. crossbeam-utils prior to version 0.8.7 incorrectly
  assumed that the alignment of `{i,u}64` was always the same as `Atomic{I,U}64`. However, the
  alignment of `{i,u}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller than `Atomic{I,U}64`. This can cause
  unaligned memory accesses and data race. Crates using `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell<{i,u}64>`
  are affected by this issue. 32-bit targets without `Atomic{I,U}64` and 64-bit targets are
  not affected by this issue. This has been fixed in crossbeam-utils 0.8.7. There are currently
  no known workarounds.
