vulnerability_id: VCID-1xu6-nh7e-aaas
aliases:
  - CVE-2023-25567
summary: GSS-NTLMSSP, a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implements NTLM authentication,
  has an out-of-bounds read when decoding target information prior to version 1.2.0. The length
  of the `av_pair` is not checked properly for two of the elements which can trigger an out-of-bound
  read. The out-of-bounds read can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry
  point and could cause a denial-of-service if the memory is unmapped. The issue is fixed in
  version 1.2.0.
