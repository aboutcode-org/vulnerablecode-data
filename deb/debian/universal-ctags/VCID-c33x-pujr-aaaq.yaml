  - CVE-2022-4515
summary: A flaw was found in Exuberant Ctags in the way it handles the "-o" option. This option
  specifies the tag filename. A crafted tag filename specified in the command line or in the
  configuration file results in arbitrary command execution because the externalSortTags() in
  sort.c calls the system(3) function in an unsafe way.
