aliases:
  - CVE-2017-9107
summary: An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. It overruns reading a buffer if a domain
  ends with backslash. If the query domain ended with \, and adns_qf_quoteok_query was specified,
  qdparselabel would read additional bytes from the buffer and try to treat them as the escape
  sequence. It would depart the input buffer and start processing many bytes of arbitrary heap
  data as if it were the query domain. Eventually it would run out of input or find some other
  kind of error, and declare the query domain invalid. But before then it might outrun available
  memory and crash. In principle this could be a denial of service attack.
