aliases:
  - CVE-2023-27371
summary: GNU libmicrohttpd before 0.9.76 allows remote DoS (Denial of Service) due to improper
  parsing of a multipart/form-data boundary in the postprocessor.c MHD_create_post_processor()
  method. This allows an attacker to remotely send a malicious HTTP POST packet that includes
  one or more '\0' bytes in a multipart/form-data boundary field, which - assuming a specific
  heap layout - will result in an out-of-bounds read and a crash in the find_boundary() function.
