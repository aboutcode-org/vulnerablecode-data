  - CVE-2023-23005
summary: '** DISPUTED ** In the Linux kernel before 6.2, mm/memory-tiers.c misinterprets the
  alloc_memory_type return value (expects it to be NULL in the error case, whereas it is actually
  an error pointer). NOTE: this is disputed by third parties because there are no realistic
  cases in which a user can cause the alloc_memory_type error case to be reached.'
