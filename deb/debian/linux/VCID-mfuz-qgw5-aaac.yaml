aliases:
  - CVE-2023-0461
summary: There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited
  to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag
  CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to be configured, but the operation does not require
  any privilege. There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock.
  When CONFIG_TLS is enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected
  tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener.
  If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable. The
  setsockopt TCP_ULP operation does not require any privilege. We recommend upgrading past commit
