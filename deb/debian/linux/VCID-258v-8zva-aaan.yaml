vulnerability_id: VCID-258v-8zva-aaan
aliases:
  - CVE-2022-3910
summary: Use After Free vulnerability in Linux Kernel allows Privilege Escalation. An improper
  Update of Reference Count in io_uring leads to Use-After-Free and Local Privilege Escalation.
  When io_msg_ring was invoked with a fixed file, it called io_fput_file() which improperly
  decreased its reference count (leading to Use-After-Free and Local Privilege Escalation).
  Fixed files are permanently registered to the ring, and should not be put separately. We recommend
  upgrading past commit https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/fc7222c3a9f56271fba02aabbfbae999042f1679
