  - CVE-2023-22464
summary: ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories.
  Versions prior to 1.2.3 and 1.1.30 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. The impact of this
  vulnerability is mitigated by the need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a Subversion
  repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance. The attack vector involves files
  with unsafe names (names that, when embedded into an HTML stream, would cause the browser
  to run unwanted code), which themselves can be challenging to create. Users should update
  to at least version 1.2.3 (if they are using a 1.2.x version of ViewVC) or 1.1.30 (if they
  are using a 1.1.x version). ViewVC 1.0.x is no longer supported, so users of that release
  lineage should implement one of the following workarounds. Users can edit their ViewVC EZT
  view templates to manually HTML-escape changed path "copyfrom paths" during rendering. Locate
  in your template set's `revision.ezt` file references to those changed paths, and wrap them
  with `[format "html"]` and `[end]`. For most users, that means that references to `[changes.copy_path]`
  will become `[format "html"][changes.copy_path][end]`. (This workaround should be reverted
  after upgrading to a patched version of ViewVC, else "copyfrom path" names will be doubly
  escaped.)
