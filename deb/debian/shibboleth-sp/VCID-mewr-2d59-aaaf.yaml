  - CVE-2023-22947
summary: '** DISPUTED ** Insecure folder permissions in the Windows installation path of Shibboleth
  Service Provider (SP) before 3.4.1 allow an unprivileged local attacker to escalate privileges
  to SYSTEM via DLL planting in the service executable''s folder. This occurs because the installation
  goes under C:\opt (rather than C:\Program Files) by default. NOTE: the vendor disputes the
  significance of this report, stating that "We consider the ACLs a best effort thing" and "it
  was a documentation mistake."'
