vulnerability_id: VCID-pe3k-1gzr-aaak
aliases:
  - CVE-2022-48337
summary: GNU Emacs through 28.2 allows attackers to execute commands via shell metacharacters
  in the name of a source-code file, because lib-src/etags.c uses the system C library function
  in its implementation of the etags program. For example, a victim may use the "etags -u *"
  command (suggested in the etags documentation) in a situation where the current working directory
  has contents that depend on untrusted input.
