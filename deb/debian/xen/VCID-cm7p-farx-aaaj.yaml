  - CVE-2022-33748
summary: lock order inversion in transitive grant copy handling As part of XSA-226 a missing
  cleanup call was inserted on an error handling path. While doing so, locking requirements
  were not paid attention to. As a result two cooperating guests granting each other transitive
  grants can cause locks to be acquired nested within one another, but in respectively opposite
  order. With suitable timing between the involved grant copy operations this may result in
  the locking up of a CPU.
