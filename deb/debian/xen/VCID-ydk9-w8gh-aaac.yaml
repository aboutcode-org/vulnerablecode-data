  - CVE-2022-42315
summary: 'Xenstore: guests can let run xenstored out of memory T[his CNA information record
  relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which
  CVE.] Malicious guests can cause xenstored to allocate vast amounts of memory, eventually
  resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) of xenstored. There are multiple ways how guests can
  cause large memory allocations in xenstored: - - by issuing new requests to xenstored without
  reading the responses, causing the responses to be buffered in memory - - by causing large
  number of watch events to be generated via setting up multiple xenstore watches and then e.g.
  deleting many xenstore nodes below the watched path - - by creating as many nodes as allowed
  with the maximum allowed size and path length in as many transactions as possible - - by accessing
  many nodes inside a transaction'
