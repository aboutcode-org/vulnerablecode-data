aliases:
  - CVE-2022-33747
summary: 'Arm: unbounded memory consumption for 2nd-level page tables Certain actions require
  e.g. removing pages from a guest''s P2M (Physical-to-Machine) mapping. When large pages are
  in use to map guest pages in the 2nd-stage page tables, such a removal operation may incur
  a memory allocation (to replace a large mapping with individual smaller ones). These memory
  allocations are taken from the global memory pool. A malicious guest might be able to cause
  the global memory pool to be exhausted by manipulating its own P2M mappings.'
