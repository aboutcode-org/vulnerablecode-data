summary: 'Xenstore: Guests can create arbitrary number of nodes via transactions T[his CNA information
  record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond
  to which CVE.] In case a node has been created in a transaction and it is later deleted in
  the same transaction, the transaction will be terminated with an error. As this error is encountered
  only when handling the deleted node at transaction finalization, the transaction will have
  been performed partially and without updating the accounting information. This will enable
  a malicious guest to create arbitrary number of nodes.'
