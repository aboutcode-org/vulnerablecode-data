summary: A request smuggling attack is possible when using MaxBytesHandler. When using MaxBytesHandler,
  the body of an HTTP request is not fully consumed. When the server attempts to read HTTP2
  frames from the connection, it will instead be reading the body of the HTTP request, which
  could be attacker-manipulated to represent arbitrary HTTP2 requests.
