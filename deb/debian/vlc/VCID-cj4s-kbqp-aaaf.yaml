vulnerability_id: VCID-cj4s-kbqp-aaaf
aliases:
  - CVE-2013-3245
summary: '** DISPUTED ** plugins/demux/libmkv_plugin.dll in VideoLAN VLC Media Player 2.0.7,
  and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
  and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted MKV file, possibly involving an integer
  overflow and out-of-bounds read or heap-based buffer overflow, or an uncaught exception.  NOTE:
  the vendor disputes the severity and claimed vulnerability type of this issue, stating "This
  PoC crashes VLC, indeed, but does nothing more... this is not an integer overflow error, but
  an uncaught exception and I doubt that it is exploitable. This uncaught exception makes VLC
  abort, not execute random code, on my Linux 64bits machine." A PoC posted by the original
  researcher shows signs of an attacker-controlled out-of-bounds read, but the affected instruction
  does not involve a register that directly influences control flow.'
