vulnerability_id: VCID-n1c8-3dnz-aaam
aliases:
  - CVE-2022-23527
summary: mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certifiedâ„¢ authentication and authorization module for
  the Apache 2.x HTTP server. Versions prior to 2.4.12.2 are vulnerable to Open Redirect. When
  providing a logout parameter to the redirect URI, the existing code in oidc_validate_redirect_url()
  does not properly check for URLs that start with /\t, leading to an open redirect. This issue
  has been patched in version 2.4.12.2. Users unable to upgrade can mitigate the issue by configuring
  mod_auth_openidc to only allow redirection when the destination matches a given regular expression
  with OIDCRedirectURLsAllowed.
