  - CVE-2009-0068
summary: Interaction error in xdg-open allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
  sending a file with a dangerous MIME type but using a safe type that Firefox sends to xdg-open,
  which causes xdg-open to process the dangerous file type through automatic type detection,
  as demonstrated by overwriting the .desktop file.
