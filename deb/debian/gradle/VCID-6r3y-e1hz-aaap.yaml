aliases:
  - CVE-2023-26053
summary: Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language
  development. This is a collision attack on long IDs (64bits) for PGP keys. Users of dependency
  verification in Gradle are vulnerable if they use long IDs for PGP keys in a `trusted-key`
  or `pgp` element in their dependency verification metadata file. The fix is to fail dependency
  verification if anything but a fingerprint is used in a trust element in dependency verification
  metadata. The problem is fixed in Gradle 8.0 and above. The problem is also patched in Gradle
  6.9.4 and 7.6.1. As a workaround, use only full fingerprint IDs for `trusted-key` or `pgp`
  element in the metadata is a protection against this issue.
