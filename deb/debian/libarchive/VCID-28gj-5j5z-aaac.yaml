vulnerability_id: VCID-28gj-5j5z-aaac
aliases:
  - CVE-2022-36227
summary: 'In libarchive before 3.6.2, the software does not check for an error after calling
  calloc function that can return with a NULL pointer if the function fails, which leads to
  a resultant NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: the discoverer cites this CWE-476 remark but third
  parties dispute the code-execution impact: "In rare circumstances, when NULL is equivalent
  to the 0x0 memory address and privileged code can access it, then writing or reading memory
  is possible, which may lead to code execution."'
