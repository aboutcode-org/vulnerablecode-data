  - CVE-2022-36070
  - GHSA-j4j9-7hg9-97g6
summary: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. To handle dependencies that come from a
  Git repository, Poetry executes various commands, e.g. `git config`. These commands are being
  executed using the executableâ€™s name and not its absolute path. This can lead to the execution
  of untrusted code due to the way Windows resolves executable names to paths. Unlike Linux-based
  operating systems, Windows searches for the executable in the current directory first and
  looks in the paths that are defined in the `PATH` environment variable afterward. This vulnerability
  can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which would lead to the takeover of the system. If a
  developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the
  exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal
  systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as
  dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing
  with untrusted files in a way they think is safe. The victim could also not protect themself
  by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory, because
  the behavior is undocumented. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.
