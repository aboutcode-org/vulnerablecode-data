vulnerability_id: VCID-hx1r-m2dn-aaaf
aliases:
  - CVE-2002-1360
summary: Multiple SSH2 servers and clients do not properly handle strings with null characters
  in them when the string length is specified by a length field, which could allow remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code due to interactions with the
  use of null-terminated strings as implemented using languages such as C, as demonstrated by
  the SSHredder SSH protocol test suite.
