vulnerability_id: VCID-vkdh-95n6-aaar
aliases:
  - CVE-2001-1585
summary: SSH protocol 2 (aka SSH-2) public key authentication in the development snapshot of
  OpenSSH 2.3.1, available from 2001-01-18 through 2001-02-08, does not perform a challenge-response
  step to ensure that the client has the proper private key, which allows remote attackers to
  bypass authentication as other users by supplying a public key from that user's authorized_keys
  file.
