  - CVE-2022-21708
summary: graphql-go is a GraphQL server with a focus on ease of use. In versions prior to 1.3.0
  there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow
  an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with
  access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn
  could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. The issue
  has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable
  the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not recommended.
