  - CVE-2022-35951
summary: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Versions 7.0.0 and above, prior
  to 7.0.5 are vulnerable to an Integer Overflow. Executing an `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream
  key in a specific state, with a specially crafted `COUNT` argument may cause an integer overflow,
  a subsequent heap overflow, and potentially lead to remote code execution. This has been patched
  in Redis version 7.0.5. No known workarounds exist.
