summary: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Authenticated users issuing specially
  crafted `SETRANGE` and `SORT(_RO)` commands can trigger an integer overflow, resulting with
  Redis attempting to allocate impossible amounts of memory and abort with an out-of-memory
  (OOM) panic. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.8, 6.2.9 and 6.0.17. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
