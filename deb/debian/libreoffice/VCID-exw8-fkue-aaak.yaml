aliases:
  - CVE-2019-9847
summary: 'A vulnerability in LibreOffice hyperlink processing allows an attacker to construct
  documents containing hyperlinks pointing to the location of an executable on the target users
  file system. If the hyperlink is activated by the victim the executable target is unconditionally
  launched. Under Windows and macOS when processing a hyperlink target explicitly activated
  by the user there was no judgment made on whether the target was an executable file, so such
  executable targets were launched unconditionally. This issue affects: All LibreOffice Windows
  and macOS versions prior to 6.1.6; LibreOffice Windows and macOS versions in the 6.2 series
  prior to 6.2.3.'
