summary: The Bluetooth Classic implementation in the Cypress WICED BT stack through 2.9.0 for
  CYW20735B1 does not properly handle the reception of a malformed LMP timing accuracy response
  followed by multiple reconnections to the link slave, allowing attackers to exhaust device
  BT resources and eventually trigger a crash via multiple attempts of sending a crafted LMP
  timing accuracy response followed by a sudden reconnection with a random BDAddress.
