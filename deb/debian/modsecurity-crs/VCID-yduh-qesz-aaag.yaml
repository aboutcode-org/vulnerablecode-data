aliases:
  - CVE-2022-39958
summary: The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a response body bypass to
  sequentially exfiltrate small and undetectable sections of data by repeatedly submitting an
  HTTP Range header field with a small byte range. A restricted resource, access to which would
  ordinarily be detected, may be exfiltrated from the backend, despite being protected by a
  web application firewall that uses CRS. Short subsections of a restricted resource may bypass
  pattern matching techniques and allow undetected access. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and
  3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators
  and users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively and to configure a CRS paranoia
  level of 3 or higher.
