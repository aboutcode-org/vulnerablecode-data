vulnerability_id: VCID-f2f1-hj9w-aaaa
aliases:
  - CVE-2022-39955
summary: The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a partial rule set bypass
  by submitting a specially crafted HTTP Content-Type header field that indicates multiple character
  encoding schemes. A vulnerable back-end can potentially be exploited by declaring multiple
  Content-Type "charset" names and therefore bypassing the configurable CRS Content-Type header
  "charset" allow list. An encoded payload can bypass CRS detection this way and may then be
  decoded by the backend. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the
  currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade
  to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively.
