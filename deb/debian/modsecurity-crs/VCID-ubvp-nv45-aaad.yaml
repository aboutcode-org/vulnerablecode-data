  - CVE-2022-39957
summary: The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a response body bypass. A
  client can issue an HTTP Accept header field containing an optional "charset" parameter in
  order to receive the response in an encoded form. Depending on the "charset", this response
  can not be decoded by the web application firewall. A restricted resource, access to which
  would ordinarily be detected, may therefore bypass detection. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x
  and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators
  and users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively.
