aliases:
  - CVE-2019-10050
summary: A buffer over-read issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.x before 4.1.4. If the input
  of the decode-mpls.c function DecodeMPLS is composed only of a packet of source address and
  destination address plus the correct type field and the right number for shim, an attacker
  can manipulate the control flow, such that the condition to leave the loop is true. After
  leaving the loop, the network packet has a length of 2 bytes. There is no validation of this
  length. Later on, the code tries to read at an empty position, leading to a crash.
