  - CVE-2022-46176
summary: Cargo is a Rust package manager. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that Cargo
  did not perform SSH host key verification when cloning indexes and dependencies via SSH. An
  attacker could exploit this to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This vulnerability
  has been assigned CVE-2022-46176. All Rust versions containing Cargo before 1.66.1 are vulnerable.
  Note that even if you don't explicitly use SSH for alternate registry indexes or crate dependencies,
  you might be affected by this vulnerability if you have configured git to replace HTTPS connections
  to GitHub with SSH (through git's [`url.<base>.insteadOf`][1] setting), as that'd cause you
  to clone the crates.io index through SSH. Rust 1.66.1 will ensure Cargo checks the SSH host
  key and abort the connection if the server's public key is not already trusted. We recommend
  everyone to upgrade as soon as possible.
