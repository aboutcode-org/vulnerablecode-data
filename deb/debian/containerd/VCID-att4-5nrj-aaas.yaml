  - CVE-2023-25153
summary: containerd is an open source container runtime. Before versions 1.6.18 and 1.5.18,
  when importing an OCI image, there was no limit on the number of bytes read for certain files.
  A maliciously crafted image with a large file where a limit was not applied could cause a
  denial of service. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.18 and 1.5.18. Users should update
  to these versions to resolve the issue. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are
  used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images.
