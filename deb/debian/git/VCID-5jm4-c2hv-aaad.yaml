vulnerability_id: VCID-5jm4-c2hv-aaad
aliases:
  - CVE-2022-23521
summary: Git is distributed revision control system. gitattributes are a mechanism to allow
  defining attributes for paths. These attributes can be defined by adding a `.gitattributes`
  file to the repository, which contains a set of file patterns and the attributes that should
  be set for paths matching this pattern. When parsing gitattributes, multiple integer overflows
  can occur when there is a huge number of path patterns, a huge number of attributes for a
  single pattern, or when the declared attribute names are huge. These overflows can be triggered
  via a crafted `.gitattributes` file that may be part of the commit history. Git silently splits
  lines longer than 2KB when parsing gitattributes from a file, but not when parsing them from
  the index. Consequentially, the failure mode depends on whether the file exists in the working
  tree, the index or both. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap reads and writes,
  which may result in remote code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published
  on 2023-01-17, going back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this issue.
