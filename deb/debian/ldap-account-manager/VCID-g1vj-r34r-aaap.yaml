  - CVE-2022-24851
summary: LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is an open source web frontend for managing entries stored
  in an LDAP directory. The profile editor tool has an edit profile functionality, the parameters
  on this page are not properly sanitized and hence leads to stored XSS attacks. An authenticated
  user can store XSS payloads in the profiles, which gets triggered when any other user try
  to access the edit profile page. The pdf editor tool has an edit pdf profile functionality,
  the logoFile parameter in it is not properly sanitized and an user can enter relative paths
  like ../../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/gvim.png via
  tools like burpsuite. Later when a pdf is exported using the edited profile the pdf icon has
  the image on that path(if image is present). Both issues require an attacker to be able to
  login to LAM admin interface. The issue is fixed in version 7.9.1.
