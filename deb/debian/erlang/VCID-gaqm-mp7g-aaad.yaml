  - CVE-2021-29221
summary: A local privilege escalation vulnerability was discovered in Erlang/OTP prior to version
  23.2.3. By adding files to an existing installation's directory, a local attacker could hijack
  accounts of other users running Erlang programs or possibly coerce a service running with
  "erlsrv.exe" to execute arbitrary code as Local System. This can occur only under specific
  conditions on Windows with unsafe filesystem permissions.
