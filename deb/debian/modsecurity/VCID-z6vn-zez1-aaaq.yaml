  - CVE-2020-15598
summary: '** DISPUTED ** Trustwave ModSecurity 3.x through 3.0.4 allows denial of service via
  a special request. NOTE: The discoverer reports "Trustwave has signaled they are disputing
  our claims." The CVE suggests that there is a security issue with how ModSecurity handles
  regular expressions that can result in a Denial of Service condition. The vendor does not
  consider this as a security issue because1) there is no default configuration issue here.
  An attacker would need to know that a rule using a potentially problematic regular expression
  was in place, 2) the attacker would need to know the basic nature of the regular expression
  itself to exploit any resource issues. It''s well known that regular expression usage can
  be taxing on system resources regardless of the use case. It is up to the administrator to
  decide on when it is appropriate to trade resources for potential security benefit.'
