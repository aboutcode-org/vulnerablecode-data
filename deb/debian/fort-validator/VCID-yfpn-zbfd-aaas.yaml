  - CVE-2021-43173
summary: In NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2, a validation run can be delayed significantly
  by an RRDP repository by not answering but slowly drip-feeding bytes to keep the connection
  alive. This can be used to effectively stall validation. While Routinator has a configurable
  time-out value for RRDP connections, this time-out was only applied to individual read or
  write operations rather than the complete request. Thus, if an RRDP repository sends a little
  bit of data before that time-out expired, it can continuously extend the time it takes for
  the request to finish. Since validation will only continue once the update of an RRDP repository
  has concluded, this delay will cause validation to stall, leading to Routinator continuing
  to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never
  serve any data at all.
