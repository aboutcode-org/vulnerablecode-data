aliases:
  - CVE-2022-4510
summary: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in ReFirm Labs binwalk from version 2.1.2b
  through 2.3.3 included. By crafting a malicious PFS filesystem file, an attacker can get binwalk's
  PFS extractor to extract files at arbitrary locations when binwalk is run in extraction mode
  (-e option). Remote code execution can be achieved by building a PFS filesystem that, upon
  extraction, would extract a malicious binwalk module into the folder .config/binwalk/plugins.
  This vulnerability is associated with program files src/binwalk/plugins/unpfs.py. This issue
  affects binwalk from 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included.
