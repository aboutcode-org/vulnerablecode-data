aliases:
  - CVE-2006-1166
summary: Monotone 0.25 and earlier, when a user creates a file in a directory called "mt", and
  when checking out that file on a case-insensitive file system such as Windows or Mac OS X,
  places the file into the "MT" bookkeeping directory, which could allow context-dependent attackers
  to execute arbitrary Lua programs as the user running monotone.
