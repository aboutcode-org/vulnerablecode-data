severities: []
summary: 'Heap-based buffer overflow in the read function in filters/words/msword-odf/wv2/src/styles.cpp
  in the Microsoft import filter in Calligra 2.4.3 and earlier allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
  code via a crafted ODF style in an ODF document. NOTE: this is the same vulnerability
  as CVE-2012-3455, but it was SPLIT by the CNA even though Calligra and KOffice share
  the same codebase.'
