summary: GNOME Geary before 3.36.3 mishandles pinned TLS certificate verification
  for IMAP and SMTP services using invalid TLS certificates (e.g., self-signed certificates)
  when the client system is not configured to use a system-provided PKCS#11 store.
  This allows a meddler in the middle to present a different invalid certificate to
  intercept incoming and outgoing mail.
