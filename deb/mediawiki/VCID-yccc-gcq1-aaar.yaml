severities: []
summary: includes/specials/SpecialChangePassword.php in MediaWiki before 1.19.14,
  1.20.x and 1.21.x before 1.21.8, and 1.22.x before 1.22.5 does not properly handle
  a correctly authenticated but unintended login attempt, which makes it easier for
  remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information by arranging for a victim
  to login to the attacker's account, as demonstrated by tracking the victim's activity,
  related to a "login CSRF" issue.
