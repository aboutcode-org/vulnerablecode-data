severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in libssh versions before 0.8.9 and before 0.9.4 in the
  way it handled AES-CTR (or DES ciphers if enabled) ciphers. The server or client
  could crash when the connection hasn't been fully initialized and the system tries
  to cleanup the ciphers when closing the connection. The biggest threat from this
  vulnerability is system availability.
