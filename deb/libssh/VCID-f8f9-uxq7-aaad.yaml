severities: []
summary: A flaw has been found in libssh in versions prior to 0.9.6. The SSH protocol
  keeps track of two shared secrets during the lifetime of the session. One of them
  is called secret_hash and the other session_id. Initially, both of them are the
  same, but after key re-exchange, previous session_id is kept and used as an input
  to new secret_hash. Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable,
  which worked as long as these buffers were same. But the key re-exchange operation
  can also change the key exchange method, which can be based on hash of different
  size, eventually creating "secret_hash" of different size than the session_id has.
  This becomes an issue when the session_id memory is zeroed or when it is used again
  during second key re-exchange.
