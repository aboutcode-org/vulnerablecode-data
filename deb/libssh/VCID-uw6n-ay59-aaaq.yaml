summary: The RAND_bytes function in libssh before 0.6.3, when forking is enabled,
  does not properly reset the state of the OpenSSL pseudo-random number generator
  (PRNG), which causes the state to be shared between children processes and allows
  local users to obtain sensitive information by leveraging a pid collision.
