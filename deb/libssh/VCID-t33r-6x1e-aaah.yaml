severities: []
summary: A flaw was found with the libssh API function ssh_scp_new() in versions before
  0.9.3 and before 0.8.8. When the libssh SCP client connects to a server, the scp
  command, which includes a user-provided path, is executed on the server-side. In
  case the library is used in a way where users can influence the third parameter
  of the function, it would become possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary commands,
  leading to a compromise of the remote target.
