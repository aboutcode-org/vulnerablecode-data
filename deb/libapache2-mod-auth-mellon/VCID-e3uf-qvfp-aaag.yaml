severities: []
summary: A vulnerability was found in mod_auth_mellon before v0.14.2. If Apache is
  configured as a reverse proxy and mod_auth_mellon is configured to only let through
  authenticated users (with the require valid-user directive), adding special HTTP
  headers that are normally used to start the special SAML ECP (non-browser based)
  can be used to bypass authentication.
