summary: 'Integer overflow in the ReadImage function in plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c
  in the GIF image format plug-in in GIMP 2.8.x and earlier allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
  code via crafted height and len properties in a GIF image file, which triggers a
  heap-based buffer overflow. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third
  party information.'
