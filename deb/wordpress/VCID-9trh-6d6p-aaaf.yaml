summary: Wordpress is an open source CMS. A user with the ability to upload files
  (like an Author) can exploit an XML parsing issue in the Media Library leading to
  XXE attacks. This requires WordPress installation to be using PHP 8. Access to internal
  files is possible in a successful XXE attack. This has been patched in WordPress
  version 5.7.1, along with the older affected versions via a minor release. We strongly
  recommend you keep auto-updates enabled.
