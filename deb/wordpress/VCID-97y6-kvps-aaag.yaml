severities: []
summary: The Incutio XML-RPC (IXR) Library, as used in WordPress before 3.9.2 and
  Drupal 6.x before 6.33 and 7.x before 7.31, permits entity declarations without
  considering recursion during entity expansion, which allows remote attackers to
  cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document
  containing a large number of nested entity references, a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.
