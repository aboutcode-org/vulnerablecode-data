summary: 'WordPress 2.6.3 relies on the REQUEST superglobal array in certain dangerous
  situations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct delayed and persistent
  cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks via crafted cookies, as demonstrated by
  attacks that (1) delete user accounts or (2) cause a denial of service (loss of
  application access).  NOTE: this issue relies on the presence of an independent
  vulnerability that allows cookie injection.'
