summary: WordPress before 5.8 lacks support for the Update URI plugin header. This
  makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a supply-chain
  attack against WordPress installations that use any plugin for which the slug satisfies
  the naming constraints of the WordPress.org Plugin Directory but is not yet present
  in that directory.
