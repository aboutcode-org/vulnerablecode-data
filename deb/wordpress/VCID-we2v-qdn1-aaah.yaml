severities: []
summary: Wordpress is an open source CMS. One of the blocks in the WordPress editor
  can be exploited in a way that exposes password-protected posts and pages. This
  requires at least contributor privileges. This has been patched in WordPress 5.7.1,
  along with the older affected versions via minor releases. It's strongly recommended
  that you keep auto-updates enabled to receive the fix.
