severities: []
summary: In in wp-includes/rest-api/endpoints/class-wp-rest-posts-controller.php in
  WordPress 3.7 to 5.3.0, authenticated users who do not have the rights to publish
  a post are able to mark posts as sticky or unsticky via the REST API. For example,
  the contributor role does not have such rights, but this allowed them to bypass
  that. This has been patched in WordPress 5.3.1, along with all the previous WordPress
  versions from 3.7 to 5.3 via a minor release.
