summary: 'WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in
  PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. ### Impact The issue allows an
  authenticated but low-privileged user (like contributor/author) to execute XSS in
  the editor. This bypasses the restrictions imposed on users who do not have the
  permission to post `unfiltered_html`. ### Patches This has been patched in WordPress
  5.8, and will be pushed to older versions via minor releases (automatic updates).
  It''s strongly recommended that you keep auto-updates enabled to receive the fix.
