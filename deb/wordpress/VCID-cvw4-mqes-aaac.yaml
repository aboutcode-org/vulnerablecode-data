summary: In affected versions of WordPress, when uploading themes, the name of the
  theme folder can be crafted in a way that could lead to JavaScript execution in
  /wp-admin on the themes page. This does require an admin to upload the theme, and
  is low severity self-XSS. This has been patched in version 5.4.2, along with all
  the previously affected versions via a minor release (5.3.4, 5.2.7, 5.1.6, 5.0.10,
  4.9.15, 4.8.14, 4.7.18, 4.6.19, 4.5.22, 4.4.23, 4.3.24, 4.2.28, 4.1.31, 4.0.31,
  3.9.32, 3.8.34, 3.7.34).
