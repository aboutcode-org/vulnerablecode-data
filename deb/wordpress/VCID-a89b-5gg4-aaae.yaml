severities: []
summary: WordPress before 5.1.1 does not properly filter comment content, leading
  to Remote Code Execution by unauthenticated users in a default configuration. This
  occurs because CSRF protection is mishandled, and because Search Engine Optimization
  of A elements is performed incorrectly, leading to XSS. The XSS results in administrative
  access, which allows arbitrary changes to .php files. This is related to wp-admin/includes/ajax-actions.php
  and wp-includes/comment.php.
