severities: []
summary: WordPress through 4.9.6 allows Author users to execute arbitrary code by
  leveraging directory traversal in the wp-admin/post.php thumb parameter, which is
  passed to the PHP unlink function and can delete the wp-config.php file. This is
  related to missing filename validation in the wp-includes/post.php wp_delete_attachment
  function. The attacker must have capabilities for files and posts that are normally
  available only to the Author, Editor, and Administrator roles. The attack methodology
  is to delete wp-config.php and then launch a new installation process to increase
  the attacker's privileges.
