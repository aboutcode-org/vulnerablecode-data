summary: WordPress before 4.9.9 and 5.x before 5.0.1 allows remote code execution
  because an _wp_attached_file Post Meta entry can be changed to an arbitrary string,
  such as one ending with a .jpg?file.php substring. An attacker with author privileges
  can execute arbitrary code by uploading a crafted image containing PHP code in the
  Exif metadata. Exploitation can leverage CVE-2019-8943.
