severities: []
summary: WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in
  PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. In affected versions output data
  of the function wp_die() can be leaked under certain conditions, which can include
  data like nonces. It can then be used to perform actions on your behalf. This has
  been patched in WordPress 5.8.1, along with any older affected versions via minor
  releases. It's strongly recommended that you keep auto-updates enabled to receive
  the fix.
