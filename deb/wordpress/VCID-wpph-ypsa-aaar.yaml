severities: []
summary: WordPress users with lower privileges (like contributors) can inject JavaScript
  code in the block editor using a specific payload, which is executed within the
  dashboard. This can lead to XSS if an admin opens the post in the editor. Execution
  of this attack does require an authenticated user. This has been patched in WordPress
  5.3.1, along with all the previous WordPress versions from 3.7 to 5.3 via a minor
  release. Automatic updates are enabled by default for minor releases and we strongly
  recommend that you keep them enabled.
