severities: []
summary: The sanitize_widget_instance function in wp-includes/class-wp-customize-widgets.php
  in WordPress before 4.2.4 does not use a constant-time comparison for widgets, which
  allows remote attackers to conduct a timing side-channel attack by measuring the
  delay before inequality is calculated.
