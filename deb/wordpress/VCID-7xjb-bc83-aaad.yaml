summary: 'Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in WordPress before 2.0.4 have unknown
  impact and remote attack vectors.  NOTE: due to lack of details, it is not clear
  how these issues are different from CVE-2006-3389 and CVE-2006-3390, although it
  is likely that 2.0.4 addresses an unspecified issue related to "Anyone can register"
