severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in avahi in versions 0.6 up to 0.8. The event used to signal
  the termination of the client connection on the avahi Unix socket is not correctly
  handled in the client_work function, allowing a local attacker to trigger an infinite
  loop. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to the availability of the avahi
  service, which becomes unresponsive after this flaw is triggered.
