severities: []
summary: 'avahi-daemon in Avahi through 0.6.32 and 0.7 inadvertently responds to IPv6
  unicast queries with source addresses that are not on-link, which allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) and may cause information
  leakage by obtaining potentially sensitive  information from the responding device
  via port-5353 UDP packets.  NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2015-2809.'
