severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for WAV input. Out-of-bounds
  writes can occur because ParseRiffHeaderConfig in riff.c does not validate the sizes
  of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow
  protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading
  to insufficient memory allocation.
