severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for W64 input. Out-of-bounds
  writes can occur because ParseWave64HeaderConfig in wave64.c does not validate the
  sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of
  integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc
  call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.
