summary: An SSRF issue was discovered in OpenStack Glance before Newton. The 'copy_from'
  feature in the Image Service API v1 allowed an attacker to perform masked network
  port scans. With v1, it is possible to create images with a URL such as 'http://localhost:22'.
  This could then allow an attacker to enumerate internal network details while appearing
  masked, since the scan would appear to originate from the Glance Image service.
