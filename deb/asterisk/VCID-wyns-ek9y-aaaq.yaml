severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.x before 13.21.1, 14.x
  before 14.7.7, and 15.x before 15.4.1 and Certified Asterisk 13.18-cert before 13.18-cert4
  and 13.21-cert before 13.21-cert2. When endpoint specific ACL rules block a SIP
  request, they respond with a 403 forbidden. However, if an endpoint is not identified,
  then a 401 unauthorized response is sent. This vulnerability just discloses which
  requests hit a defined endpoint. The ACL rules cannot be bypassed to gain access
  to the disclosed endpoints.
