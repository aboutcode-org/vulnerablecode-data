severities: []
summary: In Asterisk 11.x before 11.25.2, 13.x before 13.17.1, and 14.x before 14.6.1
  and Certified Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert17 and 13.x before 13.13-cert5, unauthorized
  command execution is possible. The app_minivm module has an "externnotify" program
  configuration option that is executed by the MinivmNotify dialplan application.
  The application uses the caller-id name and number as part of a built string passed
  to the OS shell for interpretation and execution. Since the caller-id name and number
  can come from an untrusted source, a crafted caller-id name or number allows an
  arbitrary shell command injection.
