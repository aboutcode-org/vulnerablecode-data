severities: []
summary: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written
  in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN,
  TURN, and ICE. In affected versions if the incoming RTCP BYE message contains a
  reason's length, this declared length is not checked against the actual received
  packet size, potentially resulting in an out-of-bound read access. This issue affects
  all users that use PJMEDIA and RTCP. A malicious actor can send a RTCP BYE message
  with an invalid reason length. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
  There are no known workarounds.
