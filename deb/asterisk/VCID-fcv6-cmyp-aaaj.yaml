summary: 'A Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13 before
  13.18.1, 14 before 14.7.1, and 15 before 15.1.1 and Certified Asterisk 13.13 before
  13.13-cert7. No size checking is done when setting the user field for Party B on
  a CDR. Thus, it is possible for someone to use an arbitrarily large string and write
  past the end of the user field storage buffer. NOTE: this is different from CVE-2017-7617,
  which was only about the Party A buffer.'
