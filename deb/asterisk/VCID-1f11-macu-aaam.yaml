summary: Buffer overflow in DNS SRV and NAPTR lookups in Digium Asterisk 15.x before
  15.6.2 and 16.x before 16.0.1 allows remote attackers to crash Asterisk via a specially
  crafted DNS SRV or NAPTR response, because a buffer size is supposed to match an
  expanded length but actually matches a compressed length.
