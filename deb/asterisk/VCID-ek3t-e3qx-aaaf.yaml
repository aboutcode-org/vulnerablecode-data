severities: []
summary: ConfBridge in Asterisk 11.x before 11.14.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.6 before
  11.6-cert8 does not properly handle state changes, which allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (channel hang and memory consumption) by causing transitions
  to be delayed, which triggers a state change from hung up to waiting for media.
