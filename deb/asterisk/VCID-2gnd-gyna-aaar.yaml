summary: A NULL pointer access issue was discovered in Asterisk 15.x through 15.2.1.
  The RTP support in Asterisk maintains its own registry of dynamic codecs and desired
  payload numbers. While an SDP negotiation may result in a codec using a different
  payload number, these desired ones are still stored internally. When an RTP packet
  was received, this registry would be consulted if the payload number was not found
  in the negotiated SDP. This registry was incorrectly consulted for all packets,
  even those which are dynamic. If the payload number resulted in a codec of a different
  type than the RTP stream (for example, the payload number resulted in a video codec
  but the stream carried audio), a crash could occur if no stream of that type had
  been negotiated. This was due to the code incorrectly assuming that a stream of
  that type would always exist.
