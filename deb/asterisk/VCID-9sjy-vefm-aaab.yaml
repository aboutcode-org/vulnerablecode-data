summary: An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 15.x before 15.4.1. When
  connected to Asterisk via TCP/TLS, if the client abruptly disconnects, or sends
  a specially crafted message, then Asterisk gets caught in an infinite loop while
  trying to read the data stream. This renders the system unusable.
