summary: An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.12.x and 13.13.x before
  13.13.1 and 14.x before 14.2.1. If an SDP offer or answer is received with the Opus
  codec and with the format parameters separated using a space the code responsible
  for parsing will recursively call itself until it crashes. This occurs as the code
  does not properly handle spaces separating the parameters. This does NOT require
  the endpoint to have Opus configured in Asterisk. This also does not require the
  endpoint to be authenticated. If guest is enabled for chan_sip or anonymous in chan_pjsip
  an SDP offer or answer is still processed and the crash occurs.
