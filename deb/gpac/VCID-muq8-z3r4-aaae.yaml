summary: An exploitable integer truncation vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4
  decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A
  specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an improper memory allocation resulting
  in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. The FOURCC code,
  'trik', is parsed by the function within the library. An attacker can convince a
  user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.
