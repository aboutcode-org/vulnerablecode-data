summary: Multiple exploitable integer overflow vulnerabilities exist within the MPEG-4
  decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A
  specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an integer overflow due to unchecked arithmetic
  resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker
  can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.
