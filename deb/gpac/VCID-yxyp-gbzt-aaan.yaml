summary: "An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding\
  \ functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. The library\
  \ will actually reuse the parser for atoms with the \u201Cstsz\u201D FOURCC code\
  \ when parsing atoms that use the \u201Cstz2\u201D FOURCC code and can cause an\
  \ integer overflow due to unchecked arithmetic resulting in a heap-based buffer\
  \ overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can convince a user to open\
  \ a video to trigger this vulnerability."
