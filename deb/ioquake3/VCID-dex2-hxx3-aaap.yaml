severities: []
summary: In ioquake3 before 2017-03-14, the auto-downloading feature has insufficient
  content restrictions. This also affects Quake III Arena, OpenArena, OpenJK, iortcw,
  and other id Tech 3 (aka Quake 3 engine) forks. A malicious auto-downloaded file
  can trigger loading of crafted auto-downloaded files as native code DLLs. A malicious
  auto-downloaded file can contain configuration defaults that override the user's.
  Executable bytecode in a malicious auto-downloaded file can set configuration variables
  to values that will result in unwanted native code DLLs being loaded, resulting
  in sandbox escape.
