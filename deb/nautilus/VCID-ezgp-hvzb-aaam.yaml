severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in GNOME Nautilus 3.30 prior to 3.30.6 and 3.32 prior
  to 3.32.1. A compromised thumbnailer may escape the bubblewrap sandbox used to confine
  thumbnailers by using the TIOCSTI ioctl to push characters into the input buffer
  of the thumbnailer's controlling terminal, allowing an attacker to escape the sandbox
  if the thumbnailer has a controlling terminal. This is due to improper filtering
  of the TIOCSTI ioctl on 64-bit systems, similar to CVE-2019-10063.
