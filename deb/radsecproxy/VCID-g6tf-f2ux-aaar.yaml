severities: []
summary: radsecproxy is a generic RADIUS proxy that supports both UDP and TLS (RadSec)
  RADIUS transports. Missing input validation in radsecproxy's `naptr-eduroam.sh`
  and `radsec-dynsrv.sh` scripts can lead to configuration injection via crafted radsec
  peer discovery DNS records. Users are subject to Information disclosure, Denial
  of Service, Redirection of Radius connection to a non-authenticated server leading
  to non-authenticated network access. Updated example scripts are available in the
  master branch and 1.9 release. Note that the scripts are not part of the installation
  package and are not updated automatically. If you are using the examples, you have
  to update them manually. The dyndisc scripts work independently of the radsecproxy
  code. The updated scripts can be used with any version of radsecproxy.
