summary: 'Heap-based buffer overflow in the open_man_file function in callbacks.c
  in gmanedit 0.4.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted
  man page, which is not properly handled during utf8 conversion.  NOTE: another overflow
  was reported using a configuration file, but that vector does not have a scenario
  that crosses privilege boundaries.'
