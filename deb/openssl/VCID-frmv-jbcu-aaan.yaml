summary: OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an "error state"
  mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then
  OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted
  to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions
  (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does
  not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In that scenario,
  if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function
  call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application for the
  same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted
  directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application
  bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being
  issued after having already received a fatal error. OpenSSL version 1.0.2b-1.0.2m
  are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. OpenSSL 1.1.0 is not affected.
