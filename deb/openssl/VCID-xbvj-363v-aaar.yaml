summary: During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a
  malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will cause
  the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key for this
  prime resulting in a hang until the client has finished. This could be exploited
  in a Denial Of Service attack. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0i-dev (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0h).
  Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2p-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2o).
