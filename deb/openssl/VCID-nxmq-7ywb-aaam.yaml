summary: 'The ssl23_get_client_hello function in s23_srvr.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8zc, 1.0.0o,
  and 1.0.1j does not properly handle attempts to use unsupported protocols, which
  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
  daemon crash) via an unexpected handshake, as demonstrated by an SSLv3 handshake
  to a no-ssl3 application with certain error handling.  NOTE: this issue became relevant
  after the CVE-2014-3568 fix.'
