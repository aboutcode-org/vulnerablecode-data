summary: The BN_GF2m_mod_inv function in crypto/bn/bn_gf2m.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8s,
  1.0.0 before 1.0.0e, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2b does not properly
  handle ECParameters structures in which the curve is over a malformed binary polynomial
  field, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop)
  via a session that uses an Elliptic Curve algorithm, as demonstrated by an attack
  against a server that supports client authentication.
