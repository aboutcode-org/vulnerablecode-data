summary: OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration
  file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most
  commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the --prefix / --openssldir
  configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration
  targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like
  environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
  should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such,
  find themselves looking at sub-directories of 'C:/usr/local', which may be world
  writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration,
  insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For
  OpenSSL 1.0.2, '/usr/local/ssl' is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and
  Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for
  the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own --prefix.
  OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited
  scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore
  we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected
  1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL
  1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).
