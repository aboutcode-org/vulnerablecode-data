summary: 'The ssl3_get_key_exchange function in s3_clnt.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zd,
  1.0.0 before 1.0.0p, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k allows remote SSL servers to conduct
  RSA-to-EXPORT_RSA downgrade attacks and facilitate brute-force decryption by offering
  a weak ephemeral RSA key in a noncompliant role, related to the "FREAK" issue.  NOTE:
  the scope of this CVE is only client code based on OpenSSL, not EXPORT_RSA issues
  associated with servers or other TLS implementations.'
