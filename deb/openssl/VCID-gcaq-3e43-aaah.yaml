summary: The asn1_d2i_read_bio function in crypto/asn1/a_d2i_fp.c in OpenSSL before
  0.9.8v, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0i, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1a does not properly interpret
  integer data, which allows remote attackers to conduct buffer overflow attacks,
  and cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other
  impact, via crafted DER data, as demonstrated by an X.509 certificate or an RSA
  public key.
