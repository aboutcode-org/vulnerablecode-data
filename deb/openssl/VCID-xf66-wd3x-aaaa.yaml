summary: The DH_check_pub_key function in crypto/dh/dh_check.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before
  1.0.2f does not ensure that prime numbers are appropriate for Diffie-Hellman (DH)
  key exchange, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover a private DH
  exponent by making multiple handshakes with a peer that chose an inappropriate number,
  as demonstrated by a number in an X9.42 file.
