summary: The ssl3_client_hello function in s3_clnt.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a
  does not ensure that the PRNG is seeded before proceeding with a handshake, which
  makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms
  by sniffing the network and then conducting a brute-force attack.
