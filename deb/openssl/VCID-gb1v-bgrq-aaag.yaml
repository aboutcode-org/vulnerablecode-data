summary: The DTLS retransmission implementation in OpenSSL 1.0.0 before 1.0.0l and
  1.0.1 before 1.0.1f does not properly maintain data structures for digest and encryption
  contexts, which might allow man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger the use of a
  different context and cause a denial of service (application crash) by interfering
  with packet delivery, related to ssl/d1_both.c and ssl/t1_enc.c.
