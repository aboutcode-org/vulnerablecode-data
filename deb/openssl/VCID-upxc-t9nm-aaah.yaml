summary: Because of an implementation bug the PA-RISC CRYPTO_memcmp function is effectively
  reduced to only comparing the least significant bit of each byte. This allows an
  attacker to forge messages that would be considered as authenticated in an amount
  of tries lower than that guaranteed by the security claims of the scheme. The module
  can only be compiled by the HP-UX assembler, so that only HP-UX PA-RISC targets
  are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0h (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0g).
