summary: Race condition in the ssl3_get_new_session_ticket function in ssl/s3_clnt.c
  in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zg, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0s, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and 1.0.2 before
  1.0.2b, when used for a multi-threaded client, allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (double free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified
  other impact by providing a NewSessionTicket during an attempt to reuse a ticket
  that had been obtained earlier.
