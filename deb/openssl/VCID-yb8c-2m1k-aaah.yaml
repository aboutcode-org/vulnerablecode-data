summary: If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown()
  twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond
  differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid
  padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application
  then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote
  peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data.
  In order for this to be exploitable "non-stitched" ciphersuites must be in use.
  Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites.
  Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has
  occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). Fixed in OpenSSL
  1.0.2r (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2q).
