summary: OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This
  was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order
  to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state.
  However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation
  for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the
  RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly
  reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto() explicitly using
  OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d
  (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c).
