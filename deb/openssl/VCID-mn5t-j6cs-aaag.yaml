summary: In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of the success
  or failure of a decryption attempt an attacker, after sending a very large number
  of messages to be decrypted, can recover a CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key
  or decrypt any RSA encrypted message that was encrypted with the public RSA key,
  using a Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack. Applications are not affected if they
  use a certificate together with the private RSA key to the CMS_decrypt or PKCS7_decrypt
  functions to select the correct recipient info to decrypt. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d
  (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed
  in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).
