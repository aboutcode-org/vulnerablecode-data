summary: The fmtstr function in crypto/bio/b_print.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s
  and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g improperly calculates string lengths, which allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (overflow and out-of-bounds read) or possibly
  have unspecified other impact via a long string, as demonstrated by a large amount
  of ASN.1 data, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-2842.
