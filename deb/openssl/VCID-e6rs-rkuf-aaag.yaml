summary: 'Multiple integer signedness errors in crypto/buffer/buffer.c in OpenSSL
  0.9.8v allow remote attackers to conduct buffer overflow attacks, and cause a denial
  of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact, via crafted
  DER data, as demonstrated by an X.509 certificate or an RSA public key.  NOTE: this
  vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-2110.'
