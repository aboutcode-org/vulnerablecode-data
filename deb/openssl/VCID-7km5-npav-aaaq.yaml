summary: OpenSSL before 0.9.8zd, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k does
  not enforce certain constraints on certificate data, which allows remote attackers
  to defeat a fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist protection mechanism by including
  crafted data within a certificate's unsigned portion, related to crypto/asn1/a_verify.c,
  crypto/dsa/dsa_asn1.c, crypto/ecdsa/ecs_vrf.c, and crypto/x509/x_all.c.
