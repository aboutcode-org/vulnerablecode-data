summary: OpenSSL through 1.0.2h incorrectly uses pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer
  boundary checks, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (integer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact
  by leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, related to s3_srvr.c, ssl_sess.c, and
  t1_lib.c.
