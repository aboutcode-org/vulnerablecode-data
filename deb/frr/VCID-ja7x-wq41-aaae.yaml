summary: bgpd in FRRouting FRR (aka Free Range Routing) 2.x and 3.x before 3.0.4,
  4.x before 4.0.1, 5.x before 5.0.2, and 6.x before 6.0.2 (not affecting Cumulus
  Linux or VyOS), when ENABLE_BGP_VNC is used for Virtual Network Control, allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (peering session flap) via attribute
  255 in a BGP UPDATE packet. This occurred during Disco in January 2019 because FRR
  does not implement RFC 7606, and therefore the packets with 255 were considered
  invalid VNC data and the BGP session was closed.
