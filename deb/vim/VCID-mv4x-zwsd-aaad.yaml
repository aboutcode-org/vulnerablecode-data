severities: []
summary: 'The shellescape function in Vim 7.0 through 7.2, including 7.2a.10, allows
  user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via the "!" (exclamation point)
  shell metacharacter in (1) the filename of a tar archive and possibly (2) the filename
  of the first file in a tar archive, which is not properly handled by the VIM TAR
  plugin (tar.vim) v.10 through v.22, as demonstrated by the shellescape, tarplugin.v2,
  tarplugin, and tarplugin.updated test cases.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists
  because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2712. NOTE: this issue has the same root
  cause as CVE-2008-3075.  NOTE: due to the complexity of the associated disclosures
  and the incomplete information related to them, there may be inaccuracies in this
  CVE description and in external mappings to this identifier.'
