summary: fileio.c in Vim prior to 8.0.1263 sets the group ownership of a .swp file
  to the editor's primary group (which may be different from the group ownership of
  the original file), which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by
  leveraging an applicable group membership, as demonstrated by /etc/shadow owned
  by root:shadow mode 0640, but /etc/.shadow.swp owned by root:users mode 0640, a
  different vulnerability than CVE-2017-1000382.
