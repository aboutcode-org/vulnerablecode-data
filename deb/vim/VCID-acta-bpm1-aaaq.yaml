summary: src/configure.in in Vim 5.0 through 7.1, when used for a build with Python
  support, does not ensure that the Makefile-conf temporary file has the intended
  ownership and permissions, which allows local users to execute arbitrary code by
  modifying this file during a time window, or by creating it ahead of time with permissions
  that prevent its modification by configure.
