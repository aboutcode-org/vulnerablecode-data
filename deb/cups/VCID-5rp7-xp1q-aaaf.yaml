summary: The add_job function in scheduler/ipp.c in cupsd in CUPS before 2.0.3 performs
  incorrect free operations for multiple-value job-originating-host-name attributes,
  which allows remote attackers to trigger data corruption for reference-counted strings
  via a crafted (1) IPP_CREATE_JOB or (2) IPP_PRINT_JOB request, as demonstrated by
  replacing the configuration file and consequently executing arbitrary code.
