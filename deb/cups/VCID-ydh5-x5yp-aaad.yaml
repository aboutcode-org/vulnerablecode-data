severities: []
summary: Integer overflow in the TIFF image decoding routines in CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier
  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly
  execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image, which is not properly handled by
  the (1) _cupsImageReadTIFF function in the imagetops filter and (2) imagetoraster
  filter, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
