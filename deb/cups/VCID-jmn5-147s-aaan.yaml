severities: []
summary: 'Multiple integer overflows in Xpdf 2.x and 3.x and Poppler 0.x, as used
  in the pdftops filter in CUPS 1.1.17, 1.1.22, and 1.3.7, GPdf, and kdegraphics KPDF,
  allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
  execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file that triggers a heap-based buffer
  overflow, possibly related to (1) Decrypt.cxx, (2) FoFiTrueType.cxx, (3) gmem.c,
  (4) JBIG2Stream.cxx, and (5) PSOutputDev.cxx in pdftops/. NOTE: the JBIG2Stream.cxx
  vector may overlap CVE-2009-1179.'
