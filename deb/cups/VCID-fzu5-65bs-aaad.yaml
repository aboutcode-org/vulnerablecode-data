summary: A localhost.localdomain whitelist entry in valid_host() in scheduler/client.c
  in CUPS before 2.2.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary IPP commands by
  sending POST requests to the CUPS daemon in conjunction with DNS rebinding. The
  localhost.localdomain name is often resolved via a DNS server (neither the OS nor
  the web browser is responsible for ensuring that localhost.localdomain is 127.0.0.1).
