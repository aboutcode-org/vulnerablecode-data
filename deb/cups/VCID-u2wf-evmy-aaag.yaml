severities: []
summary: The web interface in CUPS before 1.4.2, as used on Apple Mac OS X before
  10.6.2 and other platforms, does not properly handle (1) HTTP headers and (2) HTML
  templates, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
  and HTTP response splitting attacks via vectors related to (a) the product's web
  interface, (b) the configuration of the print system, and (c) the titles of printed
  jobs, as demonstrated by an XSS attack that uses the kerberos parameter to the admin
  program, and leverages attribute injection and HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) issues.
