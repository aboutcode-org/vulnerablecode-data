summary: In FreeRADIUS 3.0 through 3.0.19, on average 1 in every 2048 EAP-pwd handshakes
  fails because the password element cannot be found within 10 iterations of the hunting
  and pecking loop. This leaks information that an attacker can use to recover the
  password of any user. This information leakage is similar to the "Dragonblood" attack
  and CVE-2019-9494.
