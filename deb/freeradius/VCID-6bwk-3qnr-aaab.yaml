summary: In FreeRADIUS 3.0.x before 3.0.20, the EAP-pwd module used a global OpenSSL
  BN_CTX instance to handle all handshakes. This mean multiple threads use the same
  BN_CTX instance concurrently, resulting in crashes when concurrent EAP-pwd handshakes
  are initiated. This can be abused by an adversary as a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.
