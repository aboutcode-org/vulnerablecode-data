severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in icoutils 0.31.1. A buffer overflow was observed
  in the "decode_ne_resource_id" function in the "restable.c" source file. This is
  happening because the "len" parameter for memcpy is not checked for size and thus
  becomes a negative integer in the process, resulting in a failed memcpy. This affects
  wrestool.
