summary: 'A malicious Android application could craft an Intent that would have been
  processed by Firefox for Android and potentially result in a file overwrite in the
  user''s profile directory. One exploitation vector for this would be to supply a
  user.js file providing arbitrary malicious preference values. Control of arbitrary
  preferences can lead to sufficient compromise such that it is generally equivalent
  to arbitrary code execution.<br> *Note: This issue only affects Firefox for Android.
  Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR
  < 68.7.'
