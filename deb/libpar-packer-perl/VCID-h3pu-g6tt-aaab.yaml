summary: 'The par_mktmpdir function in the PAR::Packer module before 1.012 for Perl
  creates temporary files in a directory with a predictable name without verifying
  ownership and permissions of this directory, which allows local users to overwrite
  files when another user extracts a PAR packed program. NOTE: a similar vulnerability
  was reported for PAR, but this has been assigned a different CVE identifier.'
