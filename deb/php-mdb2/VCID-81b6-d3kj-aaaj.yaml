summary: The LOB functionality in PEAR MDB2 before 2.5.0a1 interprets a request to
  store a URL string as a request to retrieve and store the contents of the URL, which
  might allow remote attackers to use MDB2 as an indirect proxy or obtain sensitive
  information via a URL into a form field in an MDB2 application, as demonstrated
  by a file:// URL or a URL for an intranet web site.
