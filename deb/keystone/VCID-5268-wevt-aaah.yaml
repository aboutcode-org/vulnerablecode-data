severities: []
summary: OpenStack Keystone 10.x through 16.x before 16.0.2, 17.x before 17.0.1, 18.x
  before 18.0.1, and 19.x before 19.0.1 allows information disclosure during account
  locking (related to PCI DSS features). By guessing the name of an account and failing
  to authenticate multiple times, any unauthenticated actor could both confirm the
  account exists and obtain that account's corresponding UUID, which might be leveraged
  for other unrelated attacks. All deployments enabling security_compliance.lockout_failure_attempts
  are affected.
