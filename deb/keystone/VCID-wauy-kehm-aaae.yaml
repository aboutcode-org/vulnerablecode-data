severities: []
summary: In the Federation component of OpenStack Keystone before 11.0.4, 12.0.0,
  and 13.0.0, an authenticated "GET /v3/OS-FEDERATION/projects" request may bypass
  intended access restrictions on listing projects. An authenticated user may discover
  projects they have no authority to access, leaking all projects in the deployment
  and their attributes. Only Keystone with the /v3/OS-FEDERATION endpoint enabled
  via policy.json is affected.
