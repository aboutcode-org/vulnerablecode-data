summary: The ec2tokens API in OpenStack Identity (Keystone) before Havana 2013.2.1
  and Icehouse before icehouse-2 does not return a trust-scoped token when one is
  received, which allows remote trust users to gain privileges by generating EC2 credentials
  from a trust-scoped token and using them in an ec2tokens API request.
