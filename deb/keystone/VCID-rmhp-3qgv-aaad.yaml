severities: []
summary: OpenStack Keystone 15.0.0 and 16.0.0 is affected by Data Leakage in the list
  credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any credentials
  with the /v3/credentials API when enforce_scope is false. Users with a role on a
  project are able to view any other users' credentials, which could (for example)
  leak sign-on information for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP). Deployments with
  enforce_scope set to false are affected. (There will be a slight performance impact
  for the list credentials API once this issue is fixed.)
