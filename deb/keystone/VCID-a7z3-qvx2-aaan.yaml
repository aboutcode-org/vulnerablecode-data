severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0.
  Any authenticated user can create an EC2 credential for themselves for a project
  that they have a specified role on, and then perform an update to the credential
  user and project, allowing them to masquerade as another user. This potentially
  allows a malicious user to act as the admin on a project another user has the admin
  role on, which can effectively grant that user global admin privileges.
