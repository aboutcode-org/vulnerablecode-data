summary: The uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP function in common/uloc.cpp in International
  Components for Unicode (ICU) through 57.1 for C/C++ does not ensure that there is
  a '\0' character at the end of a certain temporary array, which allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other
  impact via a call with a long httpAcceptLanguage argument.
