summary: The Regular Expressions package in International Components for Unicode (ICU)
  for C/C++ before 2014-12-03, as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, calculates
  certain values without ensuring that they can be represented in a 24-bit field,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or
  possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted string, a related issue to
  CVE-2014-7923.
