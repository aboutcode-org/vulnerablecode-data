severities: []
summary: knot-resolver before version 4.3.0 is vulnerable to denial of service through
  high CPU utilization. DNS replies with very many resource records might be processed
  very inefficiently, in extreme cases taking even several CPU seconds for each such
  uncached message. For example, a few thousand A records can be squashed into one
  DNS message (limit is 64kB).
