summary: The GridFTP in Globus Toolkit (GT) before 5.2.2, when certain autoconf macros
  are defined, does not properly check the return value from the getpwnam_r function,
  which might allow remote attackers to gain privileges by logging in with a user
  that does not exist, which causes GridFTP to run as the last user in the password
  file.
