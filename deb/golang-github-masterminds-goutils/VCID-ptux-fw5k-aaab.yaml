summary: Randomly-generated alphanumeric strings contain significantly less entropy
  than expected. The RandomAlphaNumeric and CryptoRandomAlphaNumeric functions always
  return strings containing at least one digit from 0 to 9. This significantly reduces
  the amount of entropy in short strings generated by these functions.
