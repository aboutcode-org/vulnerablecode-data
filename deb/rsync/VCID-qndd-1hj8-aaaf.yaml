severities: []
summary: The receive_xattr function in xattrs.c in rsync 3.1.2 and 3.1.3-development
  does not check for a trailing '\0' character in an xattr name, which allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application
  crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by sending crafted data to the
  daemon.
