severities: []
summary: The daemon in rsync 3.1.2, and 3.1.3-development before 2017-12-03, does
  not check for fnamecmp filenames in the daemon_filter_list data structure (in the
  recv_files function in receiver.c) and also does not apply the sanitize_paths protection
  mechanism to pathnames found in "xname follows" strings (in the read_ndx_and_attrs
  function in rsync.c), which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
