severities: []
summary: Hardlink before 0.1.2 suffer from multiple stack-based buffer overflow flaws
  because of the way directory trees with deeply nested directories are processed.
  A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted directory tree, and trick the
  local user into consolidating it, leading to hardlink executable crash, or, potentially
  arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the hardlink executable.
