severities: []
summary: Hardlink before 0.1.2 has multiple integer overflows leading to heap-based
  buffer overflows because of the way string lengths concatenation is done in the
  calculation of the required memory space to be used. A remote attacker could provide
  a specially-crafted directory tree and trick the local user into consolidating it,
  leading to hardlink executable crash or potentially arbitrary code execution with
  user privileges.
