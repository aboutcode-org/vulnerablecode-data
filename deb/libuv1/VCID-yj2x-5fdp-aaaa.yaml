summary: Node.js before 16.4.1, 14.17.2, 12.22.2 is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds
  read when uv__idna_toascii() is used to convert strings to ASCII. The pointer p
  is read and increased without checking whether it is beyond pe, with the latter
  holding a pointer to the end of the buffer. This can lead to information disclosures
  or crashes. This function can be triggered via uv_getaddrinfo().
