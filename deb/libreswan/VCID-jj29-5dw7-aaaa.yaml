summary: 'programs/pluto/ikev1.c in libreswan before 3.17 retransmits in initial-responder
  states, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification)
  via a spoofed UDP packet. NOTE: the original behavior complies with the IKEv1 protocol,
  but has a required security update from the libreswan vendor; as of 2016-06-10,
  it is expected that several other IKEv1 implementations will have vendor-required
  security updates, with separate CVE IDs assigned to each.'
