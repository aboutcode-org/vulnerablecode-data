summary: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud
  Server with a computer. The Nextcloud Desktop Client invokes its uninstaller script
  when being installed to make sure there are no remnants of previous installations.
  In versions 3.0.3 through 3.2.4, the Client searches the `Uninstall.exe` file in
  a folder that can be written by regular users. This could lead to a case where a
  malicious user creates a malicious `Uninstall.exe`, which would be executed with
  administrative privileges on the Nextcloud Desktop Client installation. This issue
  is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. As a workaround, do not allow
  untrusted users to create content in the `C:\` system folder and verify that there
  is no malicious `C:\Uninstall.exe` file on the system.
