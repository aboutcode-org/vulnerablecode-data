summary: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud
  Server with a computer. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature
  download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.3.0,
  the Nextcloud Desktop client fails to check if a private key belongs to previously
  downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance serves a malicious public
  key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a
  malicious actor. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0.
  There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.
