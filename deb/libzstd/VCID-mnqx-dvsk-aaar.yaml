severities: []
summary: Beginning in v1.4.1 and prior to v1.4.9, due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-24031,
  the Zstandard command-line utility created output files with default permissions
  and restricted those permissions immediately afterwards. Output files could therefore
  momentarily be readable or writable to unintended parties.
