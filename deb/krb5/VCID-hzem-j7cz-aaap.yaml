severities: []
summary: Double free vulnerability in the init_ctx_reselect function in the SPNEGO
  initiator in lib/gssapi/spnego/spnego_mech.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.10.x
  through 1.12.x before 1.12.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code via network traffic that
  appears to come from an intended acceptor, but specifies a security mechanism different
  from the one proposed by the initiator.
