summary: The krb5_gss_process_context_token function in lib/gssapi/krb5/process_context_token.c
  in the libgssapi_krb5 library in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.11.5, 1.12.x
  through 1.12.2, and 1.13.x before 1.13.1 does not properly maintain security-context
  handles, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free
  and double free, and daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted
  GSSAPI traffic, as demonstrated by traffic to kadmind.
