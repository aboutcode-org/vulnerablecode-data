summary: Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such as can be found
  in PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given malicious input with excessive
  recursion. This could result in a Denial Of Service attack. There are no such structures
  used within SSL/TLS that come from untrusted sources so this is considered safe.
  Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0h (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0g). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2o (Affected
  1.0.2b-1.0.2n).
