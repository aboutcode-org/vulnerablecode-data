severities: []
summary: In LibTomCrypt through 1.18.2, the der_decode_utf8_string function (in der_decode_utf8_string.c)
  does not properly detect certain invalid UTF-8 sequences. This allows context-dependent
  attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) or read information
  from other memory locations via carefully crafted DER-encoded data.
