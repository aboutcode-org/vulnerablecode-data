severities: []
summary: The rsa_verify_hash_ex function in rsa_verify_hash.c in LibTomCrypt, as used
  in OP-TEE before 2.2.0, does not validate that the message length is equal to the
  ASN.1 encoded data length, which makes it easier for remote attackers to forge RSA
  signatures or public certificates by leveraging a Bleichenbacher signature forgery
  attack.
