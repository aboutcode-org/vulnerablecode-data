severities: []
summary: In util-linux before 2.32-rc1, bash-completion/umount allows local users
  to gain privileges by embedding shell commands in a mountpoint name, which is mishandled
  during a umount command (within Bash) by a different user, as demonstrated by logging
  in as root and entering umount followed by a tab character for autocompletion.
