summary: A logic error was found in the libmount library of util-linux in the function
  that allows an unprivileged user to unmount a FUSE filesystem. This flaw allows
  a local user on a vulnerable system to unmount other users' filesystems that are
  either world-writable themselves (like /tmp) or mounted in a world-writable directory.
  An attacker may use this flaw to cause a denial of service to applications that
  use the affected filesystems.
