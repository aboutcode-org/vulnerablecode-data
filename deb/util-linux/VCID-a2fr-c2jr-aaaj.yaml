summary: A logic error was found in the libmount library of util-linux in the function
  that allows an unprivileged user to unmount a FUSE filesystem. This flaw allows
  an unprivileged local attacker to unmount FUSE filesystems that belong to certain
  other users who have a UID that is a prefix of the UID of the attacker in its string
  form. An attacker may use this flaw to cause a denial of service to applications
  that use the affected filesystems.
