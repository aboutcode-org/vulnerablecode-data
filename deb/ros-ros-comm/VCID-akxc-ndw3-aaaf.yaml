summary: 'An issue was discovered in the ROS communications-related packages (aka
  ros_comm or ros-melodic-ros-comm) through 1.14.3. ROS_ASSERT_MSG only works when
  ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED is defined. This leads to a problem in the remove() function
  in clients/roscpp/src/libros/spinner.cpp. When ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED is not defined,
  the iterator loop will run out of the scope of the array, and cause denial of service
  for other components (that depend on the communication-related functions of this
  package). NOTE: The reporter of this issue now believes it was a false alarm.'
