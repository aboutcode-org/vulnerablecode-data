severities: []
summary: The "process-execute" and "process-spawn" procedures in CHICKEN Scheme used
  fixed-size buffers for holding the arguments and environment variables to use in
  its execve() call. This would allow user-supplied argument/environment variable
  lists to trigger a buffer overrun. This affects all releases of CHICKEN up to and
  including 4.11 (it will be fixed in 4.12 and 5.0, which are not yet released).
