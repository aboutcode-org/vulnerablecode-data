severities: []
summary: An incorrect "pair?" check in the Scheme "length" procedure results in an
  unsafe pointer dereference in all CHICKEN Scheme versions prior to 4.13, which allows
  an attacker to cause a denial of service by passing an improper list to an application
  that calls "length" on it.
