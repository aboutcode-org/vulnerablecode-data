summary: A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity
  using non-binary bases, when using int("text"), a system could take 50ms to parse
  an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float, decimal, int.from_bytes(),
  and int() for binary bases 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 are not affected). The highest threat
  from this vulnerability is to system availability.
