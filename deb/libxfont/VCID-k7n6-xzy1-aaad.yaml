summary: The bdfReadCharacters function in bitmap/bdfread.c in X.Org libXfont before
  1.4.9 and 1.5.x before 1.5.1 does not properly handle character bitmaps it cannot
  read, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (NULL
  pointer dereference and crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
  BDF font file.
