summary: In the PatternMatch function in fontfile/fontdir.c in libXfont through 1.5.2
  and 2.x before 2.0.2, an attacker with access to an X connection can cause a buffer
  over-read during pattern matching of fonts, leading to information disclosure or
  a crash (denial of service). This occurs because '\0' characters are incorrectly
  skipped in situations involving ? characters.
