summary: An issue was discovered in Docker Moby before 17.06.0. The Docker engine
  validated a client TLS certificate using both the configured client CA root certificate
  and all system roots on non-Windows systems. This allowed a client with any domain
  validated certificate signed by a system-trusted root CA (as opposed to one signed
  by the configured CA root certificate) to authenticate.
