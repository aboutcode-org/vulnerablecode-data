summary: '** DISPUTED ** The SwarmKit toolkit 1.12.0 for Docker allows remote authenticated
  users to cause a denial of service (prevention of cluster joins) via a long sequence
  of join and quit actions.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating that this
  sequence is not "removing the state that is left by old nodes. At some point the
  manager obviously stops being able to accept new nodes, since it runs out of memory.
  Given that both for Docker swarm and for Docker Swarmkit nodes are *required* to
  provide a secret token (it''s actually the only mode of operation), this means that
  no adversary can simply join nodes and exhaust manager resources. We can''t do anything
  about a manager running out of memory and not being able to add new legitimate nodes
  to the system. This is merely a resource provisioning issue, and definitely not
  a CVE worthy vulnerability."'
