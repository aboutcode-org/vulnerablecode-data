summary: In Docker before 18.09.4, an attacker who is capable of supplying or manipulating
  the build path for the "docker build" command would be able to gain command execution.
  An issue exists in the way "docker build" processes remote git URLs, and results
  in command injection into the underlying "git clone" command, leading to code execution
  in the context of the user executing the "docker build" command. This occurs because
  git ref can be misinterpreted as a flag.
