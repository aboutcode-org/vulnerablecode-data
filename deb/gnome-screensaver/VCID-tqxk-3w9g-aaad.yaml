summary: The default configuration in gnome-screensaver 3.5.4 through 3.6.0 sets the
  AutostartCondition line to fallback mode in the .desktop file, which prevents the
  program from starting automatically after login and allows physically proximate
  attackers to bypass screen locking and access an unattended workstation.
