severities: []
summary: gnome-screensaver 2.26.1 relies on the gnome-session D-Bus interface to determine
  session idle time, even when an Xfce desktop such as Xubuntu or Mythbuntu is used,
  which allows physically proximate attackers to access an unattended workstation
  on which screen locking had been intended.
