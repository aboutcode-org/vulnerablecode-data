summary: Apache Traffic Server before 2.0.1, and 2.1.x before 2.1.2-unstable, does
  not properly choose DNS source ports and transaction IDs, and does not properly
  use DNS query fields to validate responses, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle
  attackers to poison the internal DNS cache via a crafted response.
