severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Cinnamon 1.9.2 through 3.8.6. The cinnamon-settings-users.py
  GUI runs as root and allows configuration of (for example) other users' icon files
  in _on_face_browse_menuitem_activated and _on_face_menuitem_activated. These icon
  files are written to the respective user's $HOME/.face location. If an unprivileged
  user prepares a symlink pointing to an arbitrary location, then this location will
  be overwritten with the icon content.
