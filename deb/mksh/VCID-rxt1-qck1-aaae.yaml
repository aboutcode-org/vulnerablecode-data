severities: []
summary: The Korn shell (aka mksh) before R33d on MirOS (aka MirBSD) does not flush
  the tty's I/O when invoking mksh in a new terminal, which allows local users to
  gain privileges by opening a virtual terminal and entering command sequences, which
  might later be executed in opportunistic circumstances by a different user who launches
  mksh and specifies that terminal with the -T option.
