  JSSE). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 11.0.3 and 12.0.1. Difficult
  to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via
  TLS to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person
  other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
  unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Java SE accessible
  data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients
  running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java
  SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet)
  and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to
  Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g.,
  code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.3 (Confidentiality impacts).
