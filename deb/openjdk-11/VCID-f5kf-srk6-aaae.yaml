summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java
  SE (subcomponent: Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u201,
  7u191, 8u182 and 11; Java SE Embedded: 8u181. Difficult to exploit vulnerability
  allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise
  Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person
  other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded,
  attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this
  vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some
  of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to
  Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications
  or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g.
  code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This
  vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load
  and run only trusted code (e.g. code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base
  Score 3.4 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N).'
