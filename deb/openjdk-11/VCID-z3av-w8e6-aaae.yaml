summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
  Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 11.0.3 and 12.0.1.
  Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network
  access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require
  human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this
  vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE accessible
  data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients
  running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java
  SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet)
  and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to
  Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g.,
  code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.1 (Confidentiality impacts).
  CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).'
