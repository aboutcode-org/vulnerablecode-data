summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component: Javadoc).
  Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u231, 8u221, 11.0.4 and 13. Difficult
  to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via
  multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction
  from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE,
  attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this
  vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some
  of Java SE accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Java
  SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically
  in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets
  (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the
  internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not
  apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted
  code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.7 (Confidentiality
  and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).'
