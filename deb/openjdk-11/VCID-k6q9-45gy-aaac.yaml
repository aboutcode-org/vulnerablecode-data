  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded
  accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java
  SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
  typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed
  Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes
  from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability
  can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a
  web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.8 (Confidentiality
