summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
  Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u201, 8u192 and 11.0.1;
  Java SE Embedded: 8u191. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated
  attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful
  attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful
  attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset
  of Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
  typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed
  Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes
  from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability
  does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only
  trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.1
  (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).'
