summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java
  SE (subcomponent: Networking). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE:
  7u221, 8u212, 11.0.3 and 12.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u211. Difficult to exploit vulnerability
  allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise
  Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person
  other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
  unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data.
  Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running
  sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8),
  that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely
  on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using
  APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data
  to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.1 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).'
