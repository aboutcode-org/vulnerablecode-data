summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java
  SE (subcomponent: Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u212,
  11.0.3 and 12.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u211. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows
  unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise
  Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person
  other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded,
  attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this
  vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java
  SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
  typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed
  Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes
  from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability
  can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a
  web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.4 (Confidentiality
  impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N).'
