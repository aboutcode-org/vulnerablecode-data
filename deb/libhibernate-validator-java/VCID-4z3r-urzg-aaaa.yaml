severities: []
summary: In Hibernate Validator 5.2.x before 5.2.5 final, 5.3.x, and 5.4.x, it was
  found that when the security manager's reflective permissions, which allows it to
  access the private members of the class, are granted to Hibernate Validator, a potential
  privilege escalation can occur. By allowing the calling code to access those private
  members without the permission an attacker may be able to validate an invalid instance
  and access the private member value via ConstraintViolation#getInvalidValue().
