summary: 'If Firefox is installed to a user-writable directory, the Mozilla Maintenance
  Service would execute updater.exe from the install location with system privileges.
  Although the Mozilla Maintenance Service does ensure that updater.exe is signed
  by Mozilla, the version could have been rolled back to a previous version which
  would have allowed exploitation of an older bug and arbitrary code execution with
  System Privileges. *Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other
  operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 80, Thunderbird
  < 78.2, Thunderbird < 68.12, Firefox ESR < 68.12, and Firefox ESR < 78.2.'
