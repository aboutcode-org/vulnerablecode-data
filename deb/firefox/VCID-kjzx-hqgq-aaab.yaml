summary: The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection
  to be transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an
  HTTP connection, including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port
  80. However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443)
  did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection
  from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content
  of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP. This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic
  Encryption feature, which had low usage. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94,
  Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.
