summary: 'The Mozilla Maintenance Service "helper.exe" application creates a temporary
  directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation
  of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory
  of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged
  access. Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows.
  Other operating systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR
  < 52.2 and Firefox < 54.'
