summary: Crossbeam is a set of tools for concurrent programming. In crossbeam-channel
  before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter`
  has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter`
  does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of
  the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect
  assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect
  capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of
  iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.
