summary: 'The filename appearing in the "Downloads" panel improperly renders some
  Unicode characters, allowing for the file name to be spoofed. This can be used to
  obscure the file extension of potentially executable files from user view in the
  panel. Note: the dialog to open the file will show the full, correct filename and
  whether it is executable or not. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.'
