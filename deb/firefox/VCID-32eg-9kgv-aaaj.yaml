summary: If a Sandbox content process is compromised, it can initiate an FTP download
  which will then use a child process to render the downloaded data. The downloaded
  data can then be passed to the Chrome process with an arbitrary file length supplied
  by an attacker, bypassing sandbox protections and allow for a potential memory read
  of adjacent data from the privileged Chrome process, which may include sensitive
  data. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 66.
