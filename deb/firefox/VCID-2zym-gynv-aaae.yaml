summary: Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox for Android
  79. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that
  with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
  This vulnerability affects Firefox < 80, Firefox ESR < 78.2, Thunderbird < 78.2,
  and Firefox for Android < 80.
