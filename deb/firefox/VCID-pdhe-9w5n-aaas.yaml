summary: The lifecycle of IPC Actors allows managed actors to outlive their manager
  actors; and the former must ensure that they are not attempting to use a dead actor
  they have a reference to. Such a check was omitted in WebGL, resulting in a use-after-free
  and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84.
