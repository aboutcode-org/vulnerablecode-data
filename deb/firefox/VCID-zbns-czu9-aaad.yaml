summary: 'The Mozilla Maintenance Service does not guard against files being hardlinked
  to another file in the updates directory, allowing for the replacement of local
  files, including the Maintenance Service executable, which is run with privileged
  access. Additionally, there was a race condition during checks for junctions and
  symbolic links by the Maintenance Service, allowing for potential local file and
  directory manipulation to be undetected in some circumstances. This allows for potential
  privilege escalation by a user with unprivileged local access. <br>*Note: These
  attacks requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems
  are not affected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.'
