summary: 'The "Forget about this site" feature in the History pane is intended to
  remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes
  removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites
  that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting
  removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an http: URL rather
  than secure https: they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After
  that visit the site''s HSTS setting will be restored. This vulnerability affects
  Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.'
