summary: 'A vulnerability exists where if a user opens a locally saved HTML file,
  this file can use file: URIs to access other files in the same directory or sub-directories
  if the names are known or guessed. The Fetch API can then be used to read the contents
  of any files stored in these directories and they may uploaded to a server. It was
  demonstrated that in combination with a popular Android messaging app, if a malicious
  HTML attachment is sent to a user and they opened that attachment in Firefox, due
  to that app''s predictable pattern for locally-saved file names, it is possible
  to read attachments the victim received from other correspondents. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.'
