summary: If a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and then later set a master password,
  an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the
  older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format
  starting in Firefox 58. The new master password is added only on the new file. This
  could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations. This
  vulnerability affects Firefox < 62, Firefox ESR < 60.2.1, and Thunderbird < 60.2.1.
