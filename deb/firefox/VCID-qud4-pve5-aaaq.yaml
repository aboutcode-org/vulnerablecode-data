summary: If a URL using the "file:" protocol is dragged and dropped onto an open tab
  that is running in a different child process the tab will open a local file corresponding
  to the dropped URL, contrary to policy. One way to make the target tab open more
  reliably in a separate process is to open it with the "noopener" keyword. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 60.
