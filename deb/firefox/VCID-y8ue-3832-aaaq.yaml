summary: WebExtensions with the "ActiveTab" permission are able to access frames hosted
  within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions
  can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact
  with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 58.
