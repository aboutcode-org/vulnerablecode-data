summary: URLs using "javascript:" have the protocol removed when pasted into the addressbar
  to protect users from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, but if a tab character
  is embedded in the "javascript:" URL the protocol is not removed and the script
  will execute. This could allow users to be socially engineered to run an XSS attack
  against themselves. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 59.
