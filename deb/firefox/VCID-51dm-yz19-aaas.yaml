summary: If a page is loaded from an original site through a hyperlink and contains
  a redirect to a "data:text/html" URL, triggering a reload will run the reloaded
  "data:text/html" page with its origin set incorrectly. This allows for a cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.1, Firefox ESR
  < 52.1, and Firefox < 53.
