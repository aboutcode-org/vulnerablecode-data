summary: 'The PLUGINSPAGE functionality in Mozilla Firefox before 1.5.0.4 allows remote
  user-assisted attackers to execute privileged code by tricking a user into installing
  missing plugins and selecting the "Manual Install" button, then using nested javascript:
  URLs.  NOTE: the manual install button is used for downloading software from a remote
  web site, so this issue would not cross privilege boundaries if the user progresses
  to the point of installing malicious software from the attacker-controlled site.'
