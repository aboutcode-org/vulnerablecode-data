summary: HTTP response smuggling vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird
  before 1.5.0.4, when used with certain proxy servers, allows remote attackers to
  cause Firefox to interpret certain responses as if they were responses from two
  different sites via (1) invalid HTTP response headers with spaces between the header
  name and the colon, which might not be ignored in some cases, or (2) HTTP 1.1 headers
  through an HTTP 1.0 proxy, which are ignored by the proxy but processed by the client.
