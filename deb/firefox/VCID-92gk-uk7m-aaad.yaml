summary: 'The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading
  the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file
  can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter
  through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the
  installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance
  Service, which has privileged access. Note: This attack requires local system access
  and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox ESR < 52.2 and Firefox < 54.'
