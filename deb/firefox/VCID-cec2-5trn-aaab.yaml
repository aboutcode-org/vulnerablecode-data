summary: The combined, single character, version of the letter 'i' with any of the
  potential accents in unicode, such as acute or grave, can be spoofed in the addressbar
  by the dotless version of 'i' followed by the same accent as a second character
  with most font sets. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined
  domain names do not display as punycode. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57.
