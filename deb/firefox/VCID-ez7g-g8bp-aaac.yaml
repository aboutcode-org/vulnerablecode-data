summary: 'The Gecko Media Plugin sandbox allows access to local files that match specific
  regular expressions. On OS OX, this matching allows access to some data in subdirectories
  of "/private/var" that could expose personal or temporary data. This has been updated
  to not allow access to "/private/var" and its subdirectories. Note: this issue only
  affects OS X. Other operating systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects
  Firefox < 52 and Thunderbird < 52.'
