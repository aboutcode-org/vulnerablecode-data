summary: 'The Extensions manager in Mozilla Firefox 2.0 does not properly populate
  the list of local extensions, which allows attackers to construct an extension that
  hides itself by finding its name in the list and then calling RemoveElement, as
  demonstrated by the FFsniFF extension.  NOTE: it was later reported that 3.0 is
  also affected.'
