summary: Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with
  characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered
  as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through
  character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational
  Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the
  "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match
  the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as
  "Limited Use Scripts.". This vulnerability affects Firefox < 54, Firefox ESR < 52.2,
  and Thunderbird < 52.2.
