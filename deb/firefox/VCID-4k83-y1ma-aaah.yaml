summary: Mozilla developers reported memory safety and script safety bugs present
  in Firefox 73. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption or escalation
  of privilege and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been
  exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 74.
