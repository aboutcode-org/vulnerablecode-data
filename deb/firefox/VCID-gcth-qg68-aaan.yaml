summary: A malicious extension with the 'search' permission could have installed a
  new search engine whose favicon referenced a cross-origin URL. The response to this
  cross-origin request could have been read by the extension, allowing a same-origin
  policy bypass by the extension, which should not have cross-origin permissions.
  This cross-origin request was made without cookies, so the sensitive information
  disclosed by the violation was limited to local-network resources or resources that
  perform IP-based authentication. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 87.
