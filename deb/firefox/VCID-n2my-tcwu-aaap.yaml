summary: If a malicious attacker has used another vulnerability to gain full control
  over a content process, they may be able to replace the alternate data resources
  stored in the JavaScript Start-up Bytecode Cache (JSBC) for other JavaScript code.
  If the parent process then runs this replaced code, the executed script would be
  run with the parent process' privileges, escaping the sandbox on content processes.
