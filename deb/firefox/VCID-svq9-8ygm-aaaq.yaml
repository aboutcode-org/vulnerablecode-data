summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox before 1.5.0.5, Thunderbird before
  1.5.0.5, and SeaMonkey before 1.0.3 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via Javascript that leads to
  memory corruption, including (1) nsListControlFrame::FireMenuItemActiveEvent, (2)
  buffer overflows in the string class in out-of-memory conditions, (3) table row
  and column groups, (4) "anonymous box selectors outside of UA stylesheets," (5)
  stale references to "removed nodes," and (6) running the crypto.generateCRMFRequest
  callback on deleted context.
