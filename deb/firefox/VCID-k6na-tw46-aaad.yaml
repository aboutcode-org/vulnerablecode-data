summary: A custom cursor defined by scripting on a site can position itself over the
  addressbar to spoof the actual cursor when it should not be allowed outside of the
  primary web content area. This could be used by a malicious site to trick users
  into clicking on permission prompts, doorhanger notifications, or other buttons
  inadvertently if the location is spoofed over the user interface. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 67.
