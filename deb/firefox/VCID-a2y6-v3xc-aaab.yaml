summary: When a user loaded a Web Extensions context menu, the Web Extension could
  access the post-redirect URL of the element clicked. If the Web Extension lacked
  the WebRequest permission for the hosts involved in the redirect, this would be
  a same-origin-violation leaking data the Web Extension should have access to. This
  was fixed to provide the pre-redirect URL. This is related to CVE-2021-43532 but
  in the context of Web Extensions. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94.
