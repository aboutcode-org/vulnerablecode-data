summary: Under certain circumstances the "fetch()" API can return transient local
  copies of resources that were sent with a "no-store" or "no-cache" cache header
  instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in
  previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if
  they share a common profile while browsing. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR
  < 52.7 and Firefox < 59.
