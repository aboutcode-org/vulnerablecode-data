summary: A Blob URL can violate origin attribute segregation, allowing it to be accessed
  from a private browsing tab and for data to be passed between the private browsing
  tab and a normal tab. This could allow for the leaking of private information specific
  to the private browsing context. This issue is mitigated by the requirement that
  the user enter the Blob URL manually in order for the access violation to occur.
  This vulnerability affects Firefox < 58.
