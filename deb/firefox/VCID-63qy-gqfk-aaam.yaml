summary: If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request
  from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page.
  Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result
  in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may
  cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.
  This vulnerability affects Firefox < 58.
