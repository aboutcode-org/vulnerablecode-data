summary: A "data:" URL loaded in a new tab did not inherit the Content Security Policy
  (CSP) of the original page, allowing for bypasses of the policy including the execution
  of JavaScript. In prior versions when "data:" documents also inherited the context
  of the original page this would allow for potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
