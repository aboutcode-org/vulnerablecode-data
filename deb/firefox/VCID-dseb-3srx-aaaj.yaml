summary: Initially, a user opens a Private Browsing Window and generates a password
  for a site, then closes the Private Browsing Window but leaves Firefox open. Subsequently,
  if the user had opened a new Private Browsing Window, revisited the same site, and
  generated a new password - the generated passwords would have been identical, rather
  than independent. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 75.
