summary: Mozilla developers Tyson Smith, Bob Clary, and Alexandru Michis reported
  memory safety bugs present in Firefox 74. Some of these bugs showed evidence of
  memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have
  been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 75.
