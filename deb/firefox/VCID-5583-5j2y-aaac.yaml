summary: When network partitioning was enabled, e.g. as a result of Enhanced Tracking
  Protection settings, a TLS error page would allow the user to override an error
  on a domain which had specified HTTP Strict Transport Security (which implies that
  the error should not be override-able.) This issue did not affect the network connections,
  and they were correctly upgraded to HTTPS automatically. This vulnerability affects
  Firefox < 90.
