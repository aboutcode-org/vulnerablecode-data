summary: The developer page about:memory has a Measure function for exploring what
  object types the browser has allocated and their sizes. When this function was invoked
  we incorrectly called the sizeof function, instead of using the API method that
  checks for invalid pointers. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86.
