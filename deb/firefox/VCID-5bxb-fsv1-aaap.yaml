summary: The printing process can bypass local access protections to read files available
  through symlinks, bypassing local file restrictions. The printing process requires
  files in a specific format so arbitrary data cannot be read but it is possible that
  some local file information could be exposed. This vulnerability affects Firefox
  < 58.
