summary: When a user typed a URL in the address bar or the search bar and quickly
  hit the enter key, a website could sometimes capture that event and then redirect
  the user before navigation occurred to the desired, entered address. To construct
  a convincing spoof the attacker would have had to guess what the user was typing,
  perhaps by suggesting it. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84.
