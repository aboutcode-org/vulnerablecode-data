summary: One phishing tactic on the web is to provide a link with HTTP Auth. For example
  'https://www.phishingtarget.com@evil.com'. To mitigate this type of attack, Firefox
  will display a warning dialog; however, this warning dialog would not have been
  displayed if evil.com used a redirect that was cached by the browser. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 86.
