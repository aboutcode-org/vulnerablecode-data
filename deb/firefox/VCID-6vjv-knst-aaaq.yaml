summary: A mechanism to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections on sites
  that have a "script-src" policy of "'strict-dynamic'". If a target website contains
  an HTML injection flaw an attacker could inject a reference to a copy of the "require.js"
  library that is part of Firefox's Developer Tools, and then use a known technique
  using that library to bypass the CSP restrictions on executing injected scripts.
  This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
