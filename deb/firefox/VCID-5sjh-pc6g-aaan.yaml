summary: WebExtensions with the appropriate permissions can attach content scripts
  to Mozilla sites such as accounts.firefox.com and listen to network traffic to the
  site through the "webRequest" API. For example, this allows for the interception
  of username and an encrypted password during login to Firefox Accounts. This issue
  does not expose synchronization traffic directly and is limited to the process of
  user login to the website and the data displayed to the user once logged in. This
  vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
