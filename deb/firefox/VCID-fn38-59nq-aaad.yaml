summary: A race condition with requestPointerLock() and setTimeout() could have resulted
  in a user interacting with one tab when they believed they were on a separate tab.
  In conjunction with certain elements (such as &lt;input type="file"&gt;) this could
  have led to an attack where a user was confused about the origin of the webpage
  and potentially disclosed information they did not intend to. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 88.
