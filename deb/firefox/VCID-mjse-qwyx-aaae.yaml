  read 32 bytes of any arbitrary file on the local system by convincing the service
  that it is reading a status file provided by the Mozilla Windows Updater. The Mozilla
  Maintenance Service executes with privileged access, bypassing system protections
  against unprivileged users. Note: This attack requires local system access and only
  affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects
