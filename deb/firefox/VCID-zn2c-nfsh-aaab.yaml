summary: 'A vulnerability was discovered where specific command line arguments are
  not properly discarded during Firefox invocation as a shell handler for URLs. This
  could be used to retrieve and execute files whose location is supplied through these
  command line arguments if Firefox is configured as the default URI handler for a
  given URI scheme in third party applications and these applications insufficiently
  sanitize URL data. *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other
  operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.6,
  Firefox ESR < 60.6, and Firefox < 66.'
