summary: 'On Windows systems, the logger run by the Windows updater deletes the file
  "update.log" before it runs in order to write a new log of that name. The path to
  this file is supplied at the command line to the updater and could be used in concert
  with another local exploit to delete a different file named "update.log" instead
  of the one intended. Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other
  operating systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 55.'
