summary: 'Command line arguments could have been injected during Firefox invocation
  as a shell handler for certain unsupported file types. This required Firefox to
  be configured as the default handler for a given file type and for a file downloaded
  to be opened in a third party application that insufficiently sanitized URL data.
  In that situation, clicking a link in the third party application could have been
  used to retrieve and execute files whose location was supplied through command line
  arguments. Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems and when Firefox
  is configured as the default handler for non-default filetypes. Other operating
  systems are unaffected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 73 and Firefox < ESR68.5.'
