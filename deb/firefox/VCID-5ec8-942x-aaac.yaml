summary: Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 50.1 and Firefox ESR 45.6. Some
  of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
  effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
  affects Thunderbird < 45.7, Firefox ESR < 45.7, and Firefox < 51.
