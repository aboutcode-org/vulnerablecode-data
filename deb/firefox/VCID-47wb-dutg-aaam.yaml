summary: The "instanceof" operator can bypass the Xray wrapper mechanism. When called
  on web content from the browser itself or an extension the web content can provide
  its own result for that operator, possibly tricking the browser or extension into
  mishandling the element. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56.
