summary: 'If the Remote Debugging via USB feature was enabled in Firefox for Android
  on an Android version prior to Android 6.0, untrusted apps could have connected
  to the feature and operated with the privileges of the browser to read and interact
  with web content. The feature was implemented as a unix domain socket, protected
  by the Android SELinux policy; however, SELinux was not enforced for versions prior
  to 6.0. This was fixed by removing the Remote Debugging via USB feature from affected
  devices. *Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems
  are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83.'
