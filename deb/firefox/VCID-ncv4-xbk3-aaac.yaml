summary: 'Concurrency vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.6 and earlier allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
  code via multiple Javascript timed events that load a deeply nested XML file, followed
  by redirecting the browser to another page, which leads to a concurrency failure
  that causes structures to be freed incorrectly, as demonstrated by (1) ffoxdie and
  (2) ffoxdie3.  NOTE: it has been reported that Netscape 8.1 and K-Meleon 1.0.1 are
  also affected by ffoxdie.  Mozilla confirmed to CVE that ffoxdie and ffoxdie3 trigger
  the same underlying vulnerability.  NOTE: it was later reported that Firefox 2.0
  RC2 and 1.5.0.7 are also affected.'
