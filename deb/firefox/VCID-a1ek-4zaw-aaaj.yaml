summary: 'Mozilla Network Security Service (NSS) library before 3.11.3, as used in
  Mozilla Firefox before 1.5.0.7, Thunderbird before 1.5.0.7, and SeaMonkey before
  1.0.5, when using an RSA key with exponent 3, does not properly handle extra data
  in a signature, which allows remote attackers to forge signatures for SSL/TLS and
  email certificates, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2006-4339. NOTE: on 20061107,
  Mozilla released an advisory stating that these versions were not completely patched
  by MFSA2006-60. The newer fixes for 1.5.0.7 are covered by CVE-2006-5462.'
