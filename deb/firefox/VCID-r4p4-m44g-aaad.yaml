summary: A compromised content process could send a message to the parent process
  that would cause the 'Click to Play' permission prompt to be shown. However, due
  to lack of validation from the parent process, if the user accepted the permission
  request an attacker-controlled permission would be granted rather than the 'Click
  to Play' permission. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 70.
