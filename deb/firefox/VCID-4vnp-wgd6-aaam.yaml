summary: Until explicitly accessed by script, window.globalThis is not enumerable
  and, as a result, is not visible to code such as Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window).
  Sites that deploy a sandboxing that depends on enumerating and freezing access to
  the window object may miss this, allowing their sandboxes to be bypassed. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 68.
