summary: WebRTC in Firefox will honor persisted permissions given to sites for access
  to microphone and camera resources even when in a third-party context. In light
  of recent high profile vulnerabilities in other software, a decision was made to
  no longer persist these permissions. This avoids the possibility of trusted WebRTC
  resources being invisibly embedded in web content and abusing permissions previously
  given by users. Users will now be prompted for permissions on each use. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.
