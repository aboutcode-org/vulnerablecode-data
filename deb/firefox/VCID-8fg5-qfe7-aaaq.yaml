summary: If an attacker is able to alter specific about:config values (for example
  malware running on the user's computer), the Devtools remote debugging feature could
  have been enabled in a way that was unnoticable to the user. This would have allowed
  a remote attacker (able to make a direct network connection to the victim) to monitor
  the user's browsing activity and (plaintext) network traffic. This was addressed
  by providing a visual cue when Devtools has an open network socket. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 87.
