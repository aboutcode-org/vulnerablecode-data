summary: If the "app.support.baseURL" preference is changed by a malicious local program
  to contain HTML and script content, this content is not sanitized. It will be executed
  if a user loads "chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/preferences.xul"
  directly in a tab and executes a search. This stored preference is also executed
  whenever an EME video player plugin displays a CDM-disabled message as a notification
  message. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 59.
