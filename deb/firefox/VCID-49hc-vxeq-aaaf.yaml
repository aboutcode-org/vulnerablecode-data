summary: The Live Bookmarks page and the PDF viewer can run injected script content
  if a user pastes script from the clipboard into them while viewing RSS feeds or
  PDF files. This could allow a malicious site to socially engineer a user to copy
  and paste malicious script content that could then run with the context of either
  page but does not allow for privilege escalation. This vulnerability affects Firefox
  < 60.
