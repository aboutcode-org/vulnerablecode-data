summary: The Upgrade-Insecure-Requests (UIR) specification states that if UIR is enabled
  through Content Security Policy (CSP), navigation to a same-origin URL must be upgraded
  to HTTPS. Firefox will incorrectly navigate to an HTTP URL rather than perform the
  security upgrade requested by the CSP in some circumstances, allowing for potential
  man-in-the-middle attacks on the linked resources. This vulnerability affects Firefox
  < 66.
