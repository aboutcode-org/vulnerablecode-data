summary: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera,
  disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it
  without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording
  with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox
  < 89.
