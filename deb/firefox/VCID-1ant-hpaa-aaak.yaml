summary: Some Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters can be combined with Latin
  characters in a domain name to eclipse the non-Latin character with some font sets
  on the addressbar. The non-Latin character will not be visible to most viewers.
  This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not
  display as punycode. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57.
