summary: Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the
  panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was
  not enforced in all instances. This could allow the development tools panel for
  the extension to load a URL that it should not be able to access, including potentially
  privileged pages. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 58.
