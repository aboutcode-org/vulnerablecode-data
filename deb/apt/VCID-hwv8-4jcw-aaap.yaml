severities: []
summary: apt-get in apt before 0.7.21 does not check for the correct error code from
  gpgv, which causes apt to treat a repository as valid even when it has been signed
  with a key that has been revoked or expired, which might allow remote attackers
  to trick apt into installing malicious repositories.
