summary: The pkgAcqMetaClearSig::Failed method in apt-pkg/acquire-item.cc in Advanced
  Package Tool (APT) 0.8.11 through 0.8.15.10 and 0.8.16 before 0.8.16~exp13, when
  updating from repositories that use InRelease files, allows man-in-the-middle attackers
  to install arbitrary packages by preventing a user from downloading the new InRelease
  file, which leaves the original InRelease file active and makes it more difficult
  to detect that the Packages file is modified and unsigned.
