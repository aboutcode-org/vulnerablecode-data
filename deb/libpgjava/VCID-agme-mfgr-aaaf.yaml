summary: 'Interaction error in the PostgreSQL JDBC driver before 8.2, when used with
  a PostgreSQL server with the "standard_conforming_strings" option enabled, such
  as the default configuration of PostgreSQL 9.1, does not properly escape unspecified
  JDBC statement parameters, which allows remote attackers to perform SQL injection
  attacks. NOTE: as of 20120330, it was claimed that the upstream developer planned
  to dispute this issue, but an official dispute has not been posted as of 20121005.'
