summary: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written
  in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN,
  TURN, and ICE. In version 2.10 and earlier, PJSIP transport can be reused if they
  have the same IP address + port + protocol. However, this is insufficient for secure
  transport since it lacks remote hostname authentication. Suppose we have created
  a TLS connection to `sip.foo.com`, which has an IP address `100.1.1.1`. If we want
  to create a TLS connection to another hostname, say `sip.bar.com`, which has the
  same IP address, then it will reuse that existing connection, even though `100.1.1.1`
  does not have certificate to authenticate as `sip.bar.com`. The vulnerability allows
  for an insecure interaction without user awareness. It affects users who need access
  to connections to different destinations that translate to the same address, and
  allows man-in-the-middle attack if attacker can route a connection to another destination
  such as in the case of DNS spoofing.
