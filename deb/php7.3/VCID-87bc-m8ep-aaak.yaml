severities: []
summary: In PHP versions 7.3.x up to and including 7.3.31, 7.4.x below 7.4.25 and
  8.0.x below 8.0.12, when running PHP FPM SAPI with main FPM daemon process running
  as root and child worker processes running as lower-privileged users, it is possible
  for the child processes to access memory shared with the main process and write
  to it, modifying it in a way that would cause the root process to conduct invalid
  memory reads and writes, which can be used to escalate privileges from local unprivileged
  user to the root user.
