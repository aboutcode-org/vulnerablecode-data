severities: []
summary: In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.34, 7.3.x below 7.3.23 and 7.4.x below 7.4.11,
  when PHP is processing incoming HTTP cookie values, the cookie names are url-decoded.
  This may lead to cookies with prefixes like __Host confused with cookies that decode
  to such prefix, thus leading to an attacker being able to forge cookie which is
  supposed to be secure. See also CVE-2020-8184 for more information.
