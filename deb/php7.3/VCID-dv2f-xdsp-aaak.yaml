summary: In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.28, 7.3.x below 7.3.15 and 7.4.x below 7.4.3,
  when using file upload functionality, if upload progress tracking is enabled, but
  session.upload_progress.cleanup is set to 0 (disabled), and the file upload fails,
  the upload procedure would try to clean up data that does not exist and encounter
  null pointer dereference, which would likely lead to a crash.
