severities: []
summary: In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.31, 7.3.x below 7.3.18 and 7.4.x below 7.4.6,
  when HTTP file uploads are allowed, supplying overly long filenames or field names
  could lead PHP engine to try to allocate oversized memory storage, hit the memory
  limit and stop processing the request, without cleaning up temporary files created
  by upload request. This potentially could lead to accumulation of uncleaned temporary
  files exhausting the disk space on the target server.
