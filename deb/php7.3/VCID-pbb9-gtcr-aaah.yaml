summary: An issue was discovered in PHP before 7.1.27, 7.2.x before 7.2.16, and 7.3.x
  before 7.3.3. Due to the way rename() across filesystems is implemented, it is possible
  that file being renamed is briefly available with wrong permissions while the rename
  is ongoing, thus enabling unauthorized users to access the data.
