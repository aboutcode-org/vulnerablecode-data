summary: An issue was discovered in PHP 7.x before 7.1.26, 7.2.x before 7.2.14, and
  7.3.x before 7.3.2. dns_get_record misparses a DNS response, which can allow a hostile
  DNS server to cause PHP to misuse memcpy, leading to read operations going past
  the buffer allocated for DNS data. This affects php_parserr in ext/standard/dns.c
  for DNS_CAA and DNS_ANY queries.
