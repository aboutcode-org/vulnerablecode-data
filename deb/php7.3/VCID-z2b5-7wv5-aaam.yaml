summary: University of Washington IMAP Toolkit 2007f on UNIX, as used in imap_open()
  in PHP and other products, launches an rsh command (by means of the imap_rimap function
  in c-client/imap4r1.c and the tcp_aopen function in osdep/unix/tcp_unix.c) without
  preventing argument injection, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
  OS commands if the IMAP server name is untrusted input (e.g., entered by a user
  of a web application) and if rsh has been replaced by a program with different argument
  semantics. For example, if rsh is a link to ssh (as seen on Debian and Ubuntu systems),
  then the attack can use an IMAP server name containing a "-oProxyCommand" argument.
