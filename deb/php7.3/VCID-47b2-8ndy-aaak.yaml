severities: []
summary: In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.28, 7.3.x below 7.3.15 and 7.4.x below 7.4.3,
  when creating PHAR archive using PharData::buildFromIterator() function, the files
  are added with default permissions (0666, or all access) even if the original files
  on the filesystem were with more restrictive permissions. This may result in files
  having more lax permissions than intended when such archive is extracted.
