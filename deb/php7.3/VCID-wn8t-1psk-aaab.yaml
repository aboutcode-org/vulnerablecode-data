summary: An issue was discovered in PHP 7.3.x before 7.3.0alpha3, 7.2.x before 7.2.8,
  and before 7.1.20. The php-fpm master process restarts a child process in an endless
  loop when using program execution functions (e.g., passthru, exec, shell_exec, or
  system) with a non-blocking STDIN stream, causing this master process to consume
  100% of the CPU, and consume disk space with a large volume of error logs, as demonstrated
  by an attack by a customer of a shared-hosting facility.
