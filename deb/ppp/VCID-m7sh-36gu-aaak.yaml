summary: Improper input validation together with an integer overflow in the EAP-TLS
  protocol implementation in PPPD may cause a crash, information disclosure, or authentication
  bypass. This implementation is distributed as a patch for PPPD 0.91, and includes
  the affected eap.c and eap-tls.c files. Configurations that use the `refuse-app`
  option are unaffected.
