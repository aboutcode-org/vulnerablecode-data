summary: A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. Setparam_prefix() in
  the menu rendering code performs a length calculation on the assumption that expressing
  a quoted single quote will require 3 characters, while it actually requires 4 characters
  which allows an attacker to corrupt memory by one byte for each quote in the input.
  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity
  as well as system availability.
