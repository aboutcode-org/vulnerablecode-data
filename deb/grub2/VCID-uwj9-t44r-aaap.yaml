summary: GRUB2 contains a race condition in grub_script_function_create() leading
  to a use-after-free vulnerability which can be triggered by redefining a function
  whilst the same function is already executing, leading to arbitrary code execution
  and secure boot restriction bypass. This issue affects GRUB2 version 2.04 and prior
  versions.
