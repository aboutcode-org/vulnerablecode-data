summary: There's an issue with grub2 in all versions before 2.06 when handling squashfs
  filesystems containing a symbolic link with name length of UINT32 bytes in size.
  The name size leads to an arithmetic overflow leading to a zero-size allocation
  further causing a heap-based buffer overflow with attacker controlled data.
