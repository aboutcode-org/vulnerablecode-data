summary: A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The rmmod implementation
  allows the unloading of a module used as a dependency without checking if any other
  dependent module is still loaded leading to a use-after-free scenario. This could
  allow arbitrary code to be executed or a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The
  highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity
  as well as system availability.
