summary: A crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to a out-of-bounds write in
  the heap area. An attacker may take advantage of that to cause heap data corruption
  or eventually arbitrary code execution and circumvent secure boot protections. This
  issue has a high complexity to be exploited as an attacker needs to perform some
  triage over the heap layout to achieve signifcant results, also the values written
  into the memory are repeated three times in a row making difficult to produce valid
  payloads. This flaw affects grub2 versions prior grub-2.12.
