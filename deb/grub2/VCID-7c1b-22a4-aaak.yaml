summary: A flaw was found in grub2, prior to version 2.06. An attacker may use the
  GRUB 2 flaw to hijack and tamper the GRUB verification process. This flaw also allows
  the bypass of Secure Boot protections. In order to load an untrusted or modified
  kernel, an attacker would first need to establish access to the system such as gaining
  physical access, obtain the ability to alter a pxe-boot network, or have remote
  access to a networked system with root access. With this access, an attacker could
  then craft a string to cause a buffer overflow by injecting a malicious payload
  that leads to arbitrary code execution within GRUB. The highest threat from this
  vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
