severities: []
summary: A flaw in grub2 was found where its configuration file, known as grub.cfg,
  is being created with the wrong permission set allowing non privileged users to
  read its content. This represents a low severity confidentiality issue, as those
  users can eventually read any encrypted passwords present in grub.cfg. This flaw
  affects grub2 2.06 and previous versions. This issue has been fixed in grub upstream
  but no version with the fix is currently released.
