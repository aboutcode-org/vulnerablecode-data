summary: In grub2 versions before 2.06 the grub memory allocator doesn't check for
  possible arithmetic overflows on the requested allocation size. This leads the function
  to return invalid memory allocations which can be further used to cause possible
  integrity, confidentiality and availability impacts during the boot process.
