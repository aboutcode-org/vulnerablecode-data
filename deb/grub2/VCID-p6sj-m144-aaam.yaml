summary: GRUB2 fails to validate kernel signature when booted directly without shim,
  allowing secure boot to be bypassed. This only affects systems where the kernel
  signing certificate has been imported directly into the secure boot database and
  the GRUB image is booted directly without the use of shim. This issue affects GRUB2
  version 2.04 and prior versions.
