summary: A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. During USB device initialization,
  descriptors are read with very little bounds checking and assumes the USB device
  is providing sane values. If properly exploited, an attacker could trigger memory
  corruption leading to arbitrary code execution allowing a bypass of the Secure Boot
  mechanism. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality
  and integrity as well as system availability.
