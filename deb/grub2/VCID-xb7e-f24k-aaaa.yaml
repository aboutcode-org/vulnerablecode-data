summary: A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06, where it incorrectly
  enables the usage of the ACPI command when Secure Boot is enabled. This flaw allows
  an attacker with privileged access to craft a Secondary System Description Table
  (SSDT) containing code to overwrite the Linux kernel lockdown variable content directly
  into memory. The table is further loaded and executed by the kernel, defeating its
  Secure Boot lockdown and allowing the attacker to load unsigned code. The highest
  threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity, as well
  as system availability.
