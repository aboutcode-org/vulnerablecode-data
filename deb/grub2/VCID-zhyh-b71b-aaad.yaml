summary: There is an issue on grub2 before version 2.06 at function read_section_as_string().
  It expects a font name to be at max UINT32_MAX - 1 length in bytes but it doesn't
  verify it before proceed with buffer allocation to read the value from the font
  value. An attacker may leverage that by crafting a malicious font file which has
  a name with UINT32_MAX, leading to read_section_as_string() to an arithmetic overflow,
  zero-sized allocation and further heap-based buffer overflow.
