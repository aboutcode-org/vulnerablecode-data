summary: Integer overflows were discovered in the functions grub_cmd_initrd and grub_initrd_init
  in the efilinux component of GRUB2, as shipped in Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu (the
  functionality is not included in GRUB2 upstream), leading to a heap-based buffer
  overflow. These could be triggered by an extremely large number of arguments to
  the initrd command on 32-bit architectures, or a crafted filesystem with very large
  files on any architecture. An attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code
  and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. This issue affects GRUB2 version 2.04
  and prior versions.
