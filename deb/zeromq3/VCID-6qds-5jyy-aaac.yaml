severities: []
summary: A pointer overflow, with code execution, was discovered in ZeroMQ libzmq
  (aka 0MQ) 4.2.x and 4.3.x before 4.3.1. A v2_decoder.cpp zmq::v2_decoder_t::size_ready
  integer overflow allows an authenticated attacker to overwrite an arbitrary amount
  of bytes beyond the bounds of a buffer, which can be leveraged to run arbitrary
  code on the target system. The memory layout allows the attacker to inject OS commands
  into a data structure located immediately after the problematic buffer (i.e., it
  is not necessary to use a typical buffer-overflow exploitation technique that changes
  the flow of control).
