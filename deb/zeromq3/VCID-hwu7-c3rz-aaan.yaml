summary: There's a flaw in the zeromq server in versions before 4.3.3 in src/decoder_allocators.hpp.
  The decoder static allocator could have its sized changed, but the buffer would
  remain the same as it is a static buffer. A remote, unauthenticated attacker who
  sends a crafted request to the zeromq server could trigger a buffer overflow WRITE
  of arbitrary data if CURVE/ZAP authentication is not enabled. The greatest impact
  of this flaw is to application availability, data integrity, and confidentiality.
