summary: In ZeroMQ before version 4.3.3, there is a denial-of-service vulnerability.
  Users with TCP transport public endpoints, even with CURVE/ZAP enabled, are impacted.
  If a raw TCP socket is opened and connected to an endpoint that is fully configured
  with CURVE/ZAP, legitimate clients will not be able to exchange any message. Handshakes
  complete successfully, and messages are delivered to the library, but the server
  application never receives them. This is patched in version 4.3.3.
