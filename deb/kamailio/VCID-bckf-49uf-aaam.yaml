severities: []
summary: Kamailio before 5.4.0, as used in Sip Express Router (SER) in Sippy Softswitch
  4.5 through 5.2 and other products, allows a bypass of a header-removal protection
  mechanism via whitespace characters. This occurs in the remove_hf function in the
  Kamailio textops module. Particular use of remove_hf in Sippy Softswitch may allow
  skilled attacker having a valid credential in the system to disrupt internal call
  start/duration accounting mechanisms leading potentially to a loss of revenue.
