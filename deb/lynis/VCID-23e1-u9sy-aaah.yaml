summary: CISOfy Lynis before 3.0.0 has Incorrect Access Control because of a TOCTOU
  race condition. The routine to check the log and report file permissions was not
  working as intended and could be bypassed locally. Because of the race, an unprivileged
  attacker can set up a log and report file, and control that up to the point where
  the specific routine is doing its check. After that, the file can be removed, recreated,
  and used for additional attacks.
