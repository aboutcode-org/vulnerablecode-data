severities: []
summary: A null-pointer dereference vulnerability was found in libtirpc before version
  0.3.3-rc3. The return value of makefd_xprt() was not checked in all instances, which
  could lead to a crash when the server exhausted the maximum number of available
  file descriptors. A remote attacker could cause an rpc-based application to crash
  by flooding it with new connections.
