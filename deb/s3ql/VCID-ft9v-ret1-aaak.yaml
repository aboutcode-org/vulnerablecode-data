summary: S3QL before 2.27 mishandles checksumming, and consequently allows replay
  attacks in which an attacker who controls the backend can present old versions of
  the filesystem metadata database as up-to-date, temporarily inject zero-valued bytes
  into files, or temporarily hide parts of files. This is related to the checksum_basic_mapping
  function.
