severities: []
summary: 'In Open-iSCSI tcmu-runner 1.3.x, 1.4.x, and 1.5.x through 1.5.2, xcopy_locate_udev
  in tcmur_cmd_handler.c lacks a check for transport-layer restrictions, allowing
  remote attackers to read or write files via directory traversal in an XCOPY request.
  For example, an attack can occur over a network if the attacker has access to one
  iSCSI LUN. NOTE: relative to CVE-2020-28374, this is a similar mistake in a different
  algorithm.'
