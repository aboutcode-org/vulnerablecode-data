summary: The password hash generation algorithm in the BUILTIN authentication functionality
  for Apache Derby before 10.6.1.0 performs a transformation that reduces the size
  of the set of inputs to SHA-1, which produces a small search space that makes it
  easier for local and possibly remote attackers to crack passwords by generating
  hash collisions, related to password substitution.
