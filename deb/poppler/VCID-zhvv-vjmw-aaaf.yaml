severities: []
summary: The JPXStream::init function in Poppler 0.78.0 and earlier doesn't check
  for negative values of stream length, leading to an Integer Overflow, thereby making
  it possible to allocate a large memory chunk on the heap, with a size controlled
  by an attacker, as demonstrated by pdftocairo.
