severities: []
summary: In radare2 through 3.1.3, the armass_assemble function in libr/asm/arch/arm/armass.c
  allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service (application crash by out-of-bounds
  read) by crafting an arm assembly input because a loop uses an incorrect index in
  armass.c and certain length validation is missing in armass64.c, a related issue
  to CVE-2018-20457.
