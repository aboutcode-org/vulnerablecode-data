severities: []
summary: radare2 through 4.0.0 lacks validation of the content variable in the function
  r_asm_pseudo_incbin at libr/asm/asm.c, ultimately leading to an arbitrary write.
  This allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
  possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted input.
