severities: []
summary: The UTF-8 decoder in codecs/qutfcodec.cpp in Qt 3.3.8 and 4.2.3 does not
  reject long UTF-8 sequences as required by the standard, which allows remote attackers
  to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) and directory traversal attacks via long sequences
  that decode to dangerous metacharacters.
