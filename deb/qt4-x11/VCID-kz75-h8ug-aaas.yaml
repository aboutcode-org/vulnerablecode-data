summary: The QSslSocket::sslErrors function in Qt before 4.6.5, 4.7.x before 4.7.6,
  4.8.x before 4.8.5, when using certain versions of openSSL, uses an "incompatible
  structure layout" that can read memory from the wrong location, which causes Qt
  to report an incorrect error when certificate validation fails and might cause users
  to make unsafe security decisions to accept a certificate.
