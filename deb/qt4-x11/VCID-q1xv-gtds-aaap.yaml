summary: The QSharedMemory class in Qt 5.0.0, 4.8.x before 4.8.5, 4.7.x before 4.7.6,
  and other versions including 4.4.0 uses weak permissions (world-readable and world-writable)
  for shared memory segments, which allows local users to read sensitive information
  or modify critical program data, as demonstrated by reading a pixmap being sent
  to an X server.
