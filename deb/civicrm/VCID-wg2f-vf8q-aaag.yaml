summary: CiviCRM 2.0.0 through 4.2.9 and 4.3.0 through 4.3.3 does not properly enforce
  role-based access control (RBAC) restrictions for default custom searches, which
  allows remote authenticated users with the "access CiviCRM" permission to bypass
  intended access restrictions, as demonstrated by accessing custom contribution data
  without having the "access CiviContribute" permission.
