summary: Virt-install(1) utility used to provision new virtual machines has introduced
  an option '--unattended' to create VMs without user interaction. This option accepts
  guest VM password as command line arguments, thus leaking them to others users on
  the system via process listing. It was introduced recently in the virt-manager v2.2.0
  release.
