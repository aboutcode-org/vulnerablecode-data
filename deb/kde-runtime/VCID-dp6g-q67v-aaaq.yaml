summary: An issue was discovered in soliduiserver/deviceserviceaction.cpp in KDE Plasma
  Workspace before 5.12.0. When a vfat thumbdrive that contains `` or $() in its volume
  label is plugged in and mounted through the device notifier, it's interpreted as
  a shell command, leading to a possibility of arbitrary command execution. An example
  of an offending volume label is "$(touch b)" -- this will create a file called b
  in the home folder.
