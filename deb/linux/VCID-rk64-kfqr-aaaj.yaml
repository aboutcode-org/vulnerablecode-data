summary: A logic bug flaw was found in Linux kernel before 5.8-rc1 in the implementation
  of SSBD. A bug in the logic handling allows an attacker with a local account to
  disable SSBD protection during a context switch when additional speculative execution
  mitigations are in place. This issue was introduced when the per task/process conditional
  STIPB switching was added on top of the existing SSBD switching. The highest threat
  from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.
