summary: 'In the Linux kernel before 5.2.3, drivers/block/floppy.c allows a denial
  of service by setup_format_params division-by-zero. Two consecutive ioctls can trigger
  the bug: the first one should set the drive geometry with .sect and .rate values
  that make F_SECT_PER_TRACK be zero. Next, the floppy format operation should be
  called. It can be triggered by an unprivileged local user even when a floppy disk
  has not been inserted. NOTE: QEMU creates the floppy device by default.'
