summary: A security flaw was found in the chap_server_compute_md5() function in the
  ISCSI target code in the Linux kernel in a way an authentication request from an
  ISCSI initiator is processed. An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a stack
  buffer overflow and smash up to 17 bytes of the stack. The attack requires the iSCSI
  target to be enabled on the victim host. Depending on how the target's code was
  built (i.e. depending on a compiler, compile flags and hardware architecture) an
  attack may lead to a system crash and thus to a denial-of-service or possibly to
  a non-authorized access to data exported by an iSCSI target. Due to the nature of
  the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it
  is highly unlikely. Kernel versions 4.18.x, 4.14.x and 3.10.x are believed to be
  vulnerable.
