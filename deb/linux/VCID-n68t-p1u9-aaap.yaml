summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. An Integer Overflow
  in kernel/time/posix-timers.c in the POSIX timer code is caused by the way the overrun
  accounting works. Depending on interval and expiry time values, the overrun can
  be larger than INT_MAX, but the accounting is int based. This basically makes the
  accounting values, which are visible to user space via timer_getoverrun(2) and siginfo::si_overrun,
  random. For example, a local user can cause a denial of service (signed integer
  overflow) via crafted mmap, futex, timer_create, and timer_settime system calls.
