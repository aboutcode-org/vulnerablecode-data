summary: A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and
  ICMP redirect) in the Linux kernel functionality was found to allow the ability
  to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an off-path remote user to effectively
  bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this vulnerability
  is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP
  source port randomization are indirectly affected as well.
