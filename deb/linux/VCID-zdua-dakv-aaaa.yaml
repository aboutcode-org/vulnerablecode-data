summary: In function msm_pcm_playback_close() in all Android releases from CAF using
  the Linux kernel, prtd is assigned substream->runtime->private_data. Later, prtd
  is freed. However, prtd is not sanitized and set to NULL, resulting in a dangling
  pointer. There are other functions that access the same memory (substream->runtime->private_data)
  with a NULL check, such as msm_pcm_volume_ctl_put(), which means this freed memory
  could be used.
