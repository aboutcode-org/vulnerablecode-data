summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel present since v4.0-rc1 and through v4.13-rc4.
  A crafted network packet sent remotely by an attacker may force the kernel to enter
  an infinite loop in the cipso_v4_optptr() function in net/ipv4/cipso_ipv4.c leading
  to a denial-of-service. A certain non-default configuration of LSM (Linux Security
  Module) and NetLabel should be set up on a system before an attacker could leverage
  this flaw.
