summary: '** DISPUTED ** A memory leak in the sdma_init() function in drivers/infiniband/hw/hfi1/sdma.c
  in the Linux kernel before 5.3.9 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
  consumption) by triggering rhashtable_init() failures, aka CID-34b3be18a04e. NOTE:
  This has been disputed as not a vulnerability because "rhashtable_init() can only
  fail if it is passed invalid values in the second parameter''s struct, but when
  invoked from sdma_init() that is a pointer to a static const struct, so an attacker
  could only trigger failure if they could corrupt kernel memory (in which case a
  small memory leak is not a significant problem)."'
