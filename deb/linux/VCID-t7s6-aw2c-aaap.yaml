summary: '** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in wcd9335_codec_enable_dec in sound/soc/codecs/wcd9335.c
  in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. It uses kstrndup instead of kmemdup_nul, which
  allows attackers to have an unspecified impact via unknown vectors. NOTE: The vendor
  disputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because switching to kmemdup_nul()
  would only fix a security issue if the source string wasn''t NUL-terminated, which
  is not the case.'
