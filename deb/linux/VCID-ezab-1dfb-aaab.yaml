summary: arch/x86/kvm/svm/nested.c in the Linux kernel before 5.11.12 has a use-after-free
  in which an AMD KVM guest can bypass access control on host OS MSRs when there are
  nested guests, aka CID-a58d9166a756. This occurs because of a TOCTOU race condition
  associated with a VMCB12 double fetch in nested_svm_vmrun.
