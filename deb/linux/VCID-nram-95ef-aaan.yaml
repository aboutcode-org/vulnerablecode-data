summary: The Linux kernel before version 4.11 is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference
  in fs/cifs/cifsencrypt.c:setup_ntlmv2_rsp() that allows an attacker controlling
  a CIFS server to kernel panic a client that has this server mounted, because an
  empty TargetInfo field in an NTLMSSP setup negotiation response is mishandled during
  session recovery.
