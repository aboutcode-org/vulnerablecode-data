summary: In the Linux kernel through 4.15.4, the floppy driver reveals the addresses
  of kernel functions and global variables using printk calls within the function
  show_floppy in drivers/block/floppy.c. An attacker can read this information from
  dmesg and use the addresses to find the locations of kernel code and data and bypass
  kernel security protections such as KASLR.
