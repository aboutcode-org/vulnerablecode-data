summary: A flaw was found in the way KVM hypervisor handled x2APIC Machine Specific
  Rregister (MSR) access with nested(=1) virtualization enabled. In that, L1 guest
  could access L0's APIC register values via L2 guest, when 'virtualize x2APIC mode'
  is enabled. A guest could use this flaw to potentially crash the host kernel resulting
  in DoS issue. Kernel versions from 4.16 and newer are vulnerable to this issue.
