summary: 'Overlayfs did not properly perform permission checking when copying up files
  in an overlayfs and could be exploited from within a user namespace, if, for example,
  unprivileged user namespaces were allowed. It was possible to have a file not readable
  by an unprivileged user to be copied to a mountpoint controlled by the user, like
  a removable device. This was introduced in kernel version 4.19 by commit d1d04ef
  ("ovl: stack file ops"). This was fixed in kernel version 5.8 by commits 56230d9
  ("ovl: verify permissions in ovl_path_open()"), 48bd024 ("ovl: switch to mounter
  creds in readdir") and 05acefb ("ovl: check permission to open real file"). Additionally,
  commits 130fdbc ("ovl: pass correct flags for opening real directory") and 292f902
  ("ovl: call secutiry hook in ovl_real_ioctl()") in kernel 5.8 might also be desired
  or necessary. These additional commits introduced a regression in overlay mounts
  within user namespaces which prevented access to files with ownership outside of
  the user namespace. This regression was mitigated by subsequent commit b6650da ("ovl:
  do not fail because of O_NOATIMEi") in kernel 5.11.'
