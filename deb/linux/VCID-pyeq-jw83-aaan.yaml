summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.10.1, as used with
  Xen through 4.14.x. The Linux kernel PV block backend expects the kernel thread
  handler to reset ring->xenblkd to NULL when stopped. However, the handler may not
  have time to run if the frontend quickly toggles between the states connect and
  disconnect. As a consequence, the block backend may re-use a pointer after it was
  freed. A misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously connecting /
  disconnecting a block frontend. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot
  be ruled out. This only affects systems with a Linux blkback.
