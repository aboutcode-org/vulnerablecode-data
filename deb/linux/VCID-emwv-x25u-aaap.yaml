summary: The mincore() implementation in mm/mincore.c in the Linux kernel through
  4.19.13 allowed local attackers to observe page cache access patterns of other processes
  on the same system, potentially allowing sniffing of secret information. (Fixing
  this affects the output of the fincore program.) Limited remote exploitation may
  be possible, as demonstrated by latency differences in accessing public files from
  an Apache HTTP Server.
