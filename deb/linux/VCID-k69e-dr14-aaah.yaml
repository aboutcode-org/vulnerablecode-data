summary: The Salsa20 encryption algorithm in the Linux kernel before 4.14.8 does not
  correctly handle zero-length inputs, allowing a local attacker able to use the AF_ALG-based
  skcipher interface (CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_SKCIPHER) to cause a denial of service
  (uninitialized-memory free and kernel crash) or have unspecified other impact by
  executing a crafted sequence of system calls that use the blkcipher_walk API. Both
  the generic implementation (crypto/salsa20_generic.c) and x86 implementation (arch/x86/crypto/salsa20_glue.c)
  of Salsa20 were vulnerable.
