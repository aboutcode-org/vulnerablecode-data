summary: The do_shmat function in ipc/shm.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.12 does
  not restrict the address calculated by a certain rounding operation, which allows
  local users to map page zero, and consequently bypass a protection mechanism that
  exists for the mmap system call, by making crafted shmget and shmat system calls
  in a privileged context.
