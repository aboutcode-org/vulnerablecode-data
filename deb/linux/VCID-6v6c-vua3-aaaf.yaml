summary: There is a use-after-free in kernel versions before 5.5 due to a race condition
  between the release of ptp_clock and cdev while resource deallocation. When a (high
  privileged) process allocates a ptp device file (like /dev/ptpX) and voluntarily
  goes to sleep. During this time if the underlying device is removed, it can cause
  an exploitable condition as the process wakes up to terminate and clean all attached
  files. The system crashes due to the cdev structure being invalid (as already freed)
  which is pointed to by the inode.
