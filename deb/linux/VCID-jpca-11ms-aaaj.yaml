summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.x. kernel/bpf/verifier.c
  performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to
  side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information
  from kernel memory. Specifically, for sequences of pointer arithmetic operations,
  the pointer modification performed by the first operation is not correctly accounted
  for when restricting subsequent operations.
