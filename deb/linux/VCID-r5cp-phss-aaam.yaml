summary: 'Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory
  T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities
  correspond to which CVE.] Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel''s
  netback driver are buffered until the guest is ready to process them. There are
  some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can be bypassed
  by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop
  consuming new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is
  rather long (60 seconds by default). Using a UDP connection on a fast interface
  can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time. (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout
  could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in its
  RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which
  may be the case when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714)'
