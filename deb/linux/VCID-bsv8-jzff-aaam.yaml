summary: arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the Linux kernel through 4.6.3 mishandles the APICv
  on/off state, which allows guest OS users to obtain direct APIC MSR access on the
  host OS, and consequently cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly
  execute arbitrary code on the host OS, via x2APIC mode.
