summary: Guest triggered use-after-free in Linux xen-netback A malicious or buggy
  network PV frontend can force Linux netback to disable the interface and terminate
  the receive kernel thread associated with queue 0 in response to the frontend sending
  a malformed packet. Such kernel thread termination will lead to a use-after-free
  in Linux netback when the backend is destroyed, as the kernel thread associated
  with queue 0 will have already exited and thus the call to kthread_stop will be
  performed against a stale pointer.
