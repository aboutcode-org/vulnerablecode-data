summary: An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel
  prior to mainline 5.3. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by triggering
  AP to send IAPP location updates for stations before the required authentication
  process has completed. This could lead to different denial-of-service scenarios,
  either by causing CAM table attacks, or by leading to traffic flapping if faking
  already existing clients in other nearby APs of the same wireless infrastructure.
  An attacker can forge Authentication and Association Request packets to trigger
  this vulnerability.
