summary: kernel/sched/fair.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.9, when cpu.cfs_quota_us
  is used (e.g., with Kubernetes), allows attackers to cause a denial of service against
  non-cpu-bound applications by generating a workload that triggers unwanted slice
  expiration, aka CID-de53fd7aedb1. (In other words, although this slice expiration
  would typically be seen with benign workloads, it is possible that an attacker could
  calculate how many stray requests are required to force an entire Kubernetes cluster
  into a low-performance state caused by slice expiration, and ensure that a DDoS
  attack sent that number of stray requests. An attack does not affect the stability
  of the kernel; it only causes mismanagement of application execution.)
