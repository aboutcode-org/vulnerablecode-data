summary: An issue was discovered in xfs_setattr_nonsize in fs/xfs/xfs_iops.c in the
  Linux kernel through 5.2.9. XFS partially wedges when a chgrp fails on account of
  being out of disk quota. xfs_setattr_nonsize is failing to unlock the ILOCK after
  the xfs_qm_vop_chown_reserve call fails. This is primarily a local DoS attack vector,
  but it might result as well in remote DoS if the XFS filesystem is exported for
  instance via NFS.
