summary: net/ipv6/ip6_output.c in the Linux kernel through 3.11.4 does not properly
  determine the need for UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing of small packets
  after the UFO queueing of a large packet, which allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via network traffic that triggers a large response packet.
