summary: An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/xfs_icache.c in the Linux kernel through
  4.17.3. There is a NULL pointer dereference and panic in lookup_slow() on a NULL
  inode->i_ops pointer when doing pathwalks on a corrupted xfs image. This occurs
  because of a lack of proper validation that cached inodes are free during allocation.
