summary: kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.7 enforces incorrect
  limits for pointer arithmetic operations, aka CID-bb01a1bba579. This can be abused
  to perform out-of-bounds reads and writes in kernel memory, leading to local privilege
  escalation to root. In particular, there is a corner case where the off reg causes
  a masking direction change, which then results in an incorrect final aux->alu_limit.
