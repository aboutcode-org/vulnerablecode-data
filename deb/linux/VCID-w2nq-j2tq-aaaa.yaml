summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handle_rx() function in the [vhost_net]
  driver. A malicious virtual guest, under specific conditions, can trigger an out-of-bounds
  write in a kmalloc-8 slab on a virtual host which may lead to a kernel memory corruption
  and a system panic. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be
  fully ruled out. Versions from v4.16 and newer are vulnerable.
