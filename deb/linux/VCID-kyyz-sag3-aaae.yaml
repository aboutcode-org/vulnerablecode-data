summary: 'The ioapic_deliver function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through
  3.14.1 does not properly validate the kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic return value, which
  allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) via a crafted
  entry in the redirection table of an I/O APIC. NOTE: the affected code was moved
  to the ioapic_service function before the vulnerability was announced.'
