summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.11, as used in Xen
  through 4.11.x. The xen_failsafe_callback entry point in arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S
  does not properly maintain RBX, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
  (uninitialized memory usage and system crash). Within Xen, 64-bit x86 PV Linux guest
  OS users can trigger a guest OS crash or possibly gain privileges.
