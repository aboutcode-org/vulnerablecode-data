summary: The sr_do_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/sr_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel through
  4.16.12 allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow)
  or possibly have unspecified other impact because sense buffers have different sizes
  at the CDROM layer and the SCSI layer, as demonstrated by a CDROMREADMODE2 ioctl
  call.
