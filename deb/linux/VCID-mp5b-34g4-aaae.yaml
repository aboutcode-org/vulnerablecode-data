summary: A buffer over-read flaw was found in RH kernel versions before 5.0 in crypto_authenc_extractkeys
  in crypto/authenc.c in the IPsec Cryptographic algorithm's module, authenc. When
  a payload longer than 4 bytes, and is not following 4-byte alignment boundary guidelines,
  it causes a buffer over-read threat, leading to a system crash. This flaw allows
  a local attacker with user privileges to cause a denial of service.
