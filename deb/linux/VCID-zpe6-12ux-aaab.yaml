summary: 'The sg implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.9 does not properly
  restrict write operations in situations where the KERNEL_DS option is set, which
  allows local users to read or write to arbitrary kernel memory locations or cause
  a denial of service (use-after-free) by leveraging access to a /dev/sg device, related
  to block/bsg.c and drivers/scsi/sg.c.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of
  an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-9576.'
