summary: It was found that the raw midi kernel driver does not protect against concurrent
  access which leads to a double realloc (double free) in snd_rawmidi_input_params()
  and snd_rawmidi_output_status() which are part of snd_rawmidi_ioctl() handler in
  rawmidi.c file. A malicious local attacker could possibly use this for privilege
  escalation.
