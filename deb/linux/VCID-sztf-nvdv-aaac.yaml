summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc4. A failure of the file
  system metadata validator in XFS can cause an inode with a valid, user-creatable
  extended attribute to be flagged as corrupt. This can lead to the filesystem being
  shutdown, or otherwise rendered inaccessible until it is remounted, leading to a
  denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
