summary: An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in x25_bind in net/x25/af_x25.c
  in the Linux kernel version v5.12-rc5. A bounds check failure allows a local attacker
  with a user account on the system to gain access to out-of-bounds memory, leading
  to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from
  this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.
