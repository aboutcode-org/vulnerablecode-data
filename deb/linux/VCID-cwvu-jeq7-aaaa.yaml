summary: The xsave/xrstor implementation in arch/x86/include/asm/xsave.h in the Linux
  kernel before 3.19.2 creates certain .altinstr_replacement pointers and consequently
  does not provide any protection against instruction faulting, which allows local
  users to cause a denial of service (panic) by triggering a fault, as demonstrated
  by an unaligned memory operand or a non-canonical address memory operand.
