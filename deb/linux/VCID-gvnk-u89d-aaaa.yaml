summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.18.6. An information
  leak in cdrom_ioctl_drive_status in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c could be used by local
  attackers to read kernel memory because a cast from unsigned long to int interferes
  with bounds checking. This is similar to CVE-2018-10940.
