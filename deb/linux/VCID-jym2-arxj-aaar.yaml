summary: 'The __mptctl_ioctl function in drivers/message/fusion/mptctl.c in the Linux
  kernel before 5.4.14 allows local users to hold an incorrect lock during the ioctl
  operation and trigger a race condition, i.e., a "double fetch" vulnerability, aka
  CID-28d76df18f0a. NOTE: the vendor states "The security impact of this bug is not
  as bad as it could have been because these operations are all privileged and root
  already has enormous destructive power."'
