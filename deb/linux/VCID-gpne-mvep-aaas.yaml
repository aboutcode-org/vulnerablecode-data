summary: The IP stack in the Linux kernel before 4.6 allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (stack consumption and panic) or possibly have unspecified other
  impact by triggering use of the GRO path for packets with tunnel stacking, as demonstrated
  by interleaved IPv4 headers and GRE headers, a related issue to CVE-2016-7039.
