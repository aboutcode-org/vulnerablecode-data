summary: "** DISPUTED ** __btrfs_free_extent in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux\
  \ kernel through 5.3.12 calls btrfs_print_leaf in a certain ENOENT case, which allows\
  \ local users to obtain potentially sensitive information about register values\
  \ via the dmesg program. NOTE: The BTRFS development team disputes this issues as\
  \ not being a vulnerability because \u201C1) The kernel provide facilities to restrict\
  \ access to dmesg - dmesg_restrict=1 sysctl option. So it's really up to the system\
  \ administrator to judge whether dmesg access shall be disallowed or not. 2) WARN/WARN_ON\
  \ are widely used macros in the linux kernel. If this CVE is considered valid this\
  \ would mean there are literally thousands CVE lurking in the kernel - something\
  \ which clearly is not the case.\u201D"
