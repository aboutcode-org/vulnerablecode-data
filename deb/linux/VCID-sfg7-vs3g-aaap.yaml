severities: []
summary: The n_tty_write function in drivers/tty/n_tty.c in the Linux kernel through
  3.14.3 does not properly manage tty driver access in the "LECHO & !OPOST" case,
  which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system
  crash) or gain privileges by triggering a race condition involving read and write
  operations with long strings.
