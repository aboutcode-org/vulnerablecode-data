summary: Jonathan Looney discovered that the TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->tcp_gso_segs value was
  subject to an integer overflow in the Linux kernel when handling TCP Selective Acknowledgments
  (SACKs). A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This has
  been fixed in stable kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11,
  and is fixed in commit 3b4929f65b0d8249f19a50245cd88ed1a2f78cff.
