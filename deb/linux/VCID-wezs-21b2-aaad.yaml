summary: 'The __get_user_asm_ex macro in arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h in the Linux
  kernel 4.4.22 through 4.4.28 contains extended asm statements that are incompatible
  with the exception table, which allows local users to obtain root access on non-SMEP
  platforms via a crafted application.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of
  incorrect backporting of the CVE-2016-9178 patch to older kernels.'
