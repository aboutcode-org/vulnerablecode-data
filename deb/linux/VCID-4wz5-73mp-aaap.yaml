summary: It was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.11-rc8 that root can gain
  direct access to an internal keyring, such as '.dns_resolver' in RHEL-7 or '.builtin_trusted_keys'
  upstream, by joining it as its session keyring. This allows root to bypass module
  signature verification by adding a new public key of its own devising to the keyring.
