summary: An unprivileged write to the file handler flaw in the Linux kernel's control
  groups and namespaces subsystem was found in the way users have access to some less
  privileged process that are controlled by cgroups and have higher privileged parent
  process. It is actually both for cgroup2 and cgroup1 versions of control groups.
  A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges
  on the system.
