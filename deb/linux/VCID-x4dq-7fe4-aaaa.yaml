summary: arch/arm64/kvm/guest.c in KVM in the Linux kernel before 4.18.12 on the arm64
  platform mishandles the KVM_SET_ON_REG ioctl. This is exploitable by attackers who
  can create virtual machines. An attacker can arbitrarily redirect the hypervisor
  flow of control (with full register control). An attacker can also cause a denial
  of service (hypervisor panic) via an illegal exception return. This occurs because
  of insufficient restrictions on userspace access to the core register file, and
  because PSTATE.M validation does not prevent unintended execution modes.
