summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel that allows the userspace to call memcpy_fromiovecend()
  and similar functions with a zero offset and buffer length which causes the read
  beyond the buffer boundaries, in certain cases causing a memory access fault and
  a system halt by accessing invalid memory address. This issue only affects kernel
  version 3.10.x as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
