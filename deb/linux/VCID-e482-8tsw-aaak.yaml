summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c
  performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to
  side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information
  from kernel memory, aka CID-f232326f6966. This affects pointer types that do not
  define a ptr_limit.
