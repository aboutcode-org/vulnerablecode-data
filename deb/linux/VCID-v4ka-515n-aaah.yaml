summary: 'The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in
  the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 does not properly handle invalid instructions,
  which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
  and host OS crash) via a crafted application that triggers (1) an improperly fetched
  instruction or (2) an instruction that occupies too many bytes.  NOTE: this vulnerability
  exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-8480.'
