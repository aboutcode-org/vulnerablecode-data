summary: kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.1 performs undesirable
  speculative loads, leading to disclosure of stack content via side-channel attacks,
  aka CID-801c6058d14a. The specific concern is not protecting the BPF stack area
  against speculative loads. Also, the BPF stack can contain uninitialized data that
  might represent sensitive information previously operated on by the kernel.
