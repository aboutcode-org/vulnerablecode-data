summary: A race condition in perf_event_open() allows local attackers to leak sensitive
  data from setuid programs. As no relevant locks (in particular the cred_guard_mutex)
  are held during the ptrace_may_access() call, it is possible for the specified target
  task to perform an execve() syscall with setuid execution before perf_event_alloc()
  actually attaches to it, allowing an attacker to bypass the ptrace_may_access()
  check and the perf_event_exit_task(current) call that is performed in install_exec_creds()
  during privileged execve() calls. This issue affects kernel versions before 4.8.
