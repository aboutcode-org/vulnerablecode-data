summary: A kernel data leak due to an out-of-bound read was found in the Linux kernel
  in inet_diag_msg_sctp{,l}addr_fill() and sctp_get_sctp_info() functions present
  since version 4.7-rc1 through version 4.13. A data leak happens when these functions
  fill in sockaddr data structures used to export socket's diagnostic information.
  As a result, up to 100 bytes of the slab data could be leaked to a userspace.
