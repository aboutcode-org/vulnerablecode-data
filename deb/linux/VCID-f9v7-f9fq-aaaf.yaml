summary: A flaw was found in the crypto subsystem of the Linux kernel before version
  kernel-4.15-rc4. The "null skcipher" was being dropped when each af_alg_ctx was
  freed instead of when the aead_tfm was freed. This can cause the null skcipher to
  be freed while it is still in use leading to a local user being able to crash the
  system or possibly escalate privileges.
