summary: '** DISPUTED ** gss_mech_free in net/sunrpc/auth_gss/gss_mech_switch.c in
  the rpcsec_gss_krb5 implementation in the Linux kernel through 5.6.10 lacks certain
  domain_release calls, leading to a memory leak. Note: This was disputed with the
  assertion that the issue does not grant any access not already available. It is
  a problem that on unloading a specific kernel module some memory is leaked, but
  loading kernel modules is a privileged operation. A user could also write a kernel
  module to consume any amount of memory they like and load that replicating the effect
  of this bug.'
