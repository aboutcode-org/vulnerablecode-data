summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Some OSes (such as Linux,
  FreeBSD, and NetBSD) are processing watch events using a single thread. If the events
  are received faster than the thread is able to handle, they will get queued. As
  the queue is unbounded, a guest may be able to trigger an OOM in the backend. All
  systems with a FreeBSD, Linux, or NetBSD (any version) dom0 are vulnerable.
