summary: 'net/ipv4/route.c in the Linux kernel 4.13-rc1 through 4.13-rc6 is too late
  to check for a NULL fi field when RTM_F_FIB_MATCH is set, which allows local users
  to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via crafted system calls. NOTE: this does not affect any stable release.'
