summary: 'The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a SYN
  cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network connection, which allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many
  TCP SYN packets, as demonstrated by an attack against the kernel-3.10.0 package
  in CentOS Linux 7. NOTE: third parties have been unable to discern any relationship
  between the GitHub Engineering finding and the Trigemini.c attack code.'
