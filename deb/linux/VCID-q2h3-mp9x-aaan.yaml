summary: 'The io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed the MAX_RW_COUNT limit
  to be bypassed in the PROVIDE_BUFFERS operation, which led to negative values being
  usedin mem_rw when reading /proc/<PID>/mem. This could be used to create a heap
  overflow leading to arbitrary code execution in the kernel. It was addressed via
  commit d1f82808877b ("io_uring: truncate lengths larger than MAX_RW_COUNT on provide
  buffers") (v5.13-rc1) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21,
  and v5.10.37. It was introduced in ddf0322db79c ("io_uring: add IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS")
  (v5.7-rc1).'
