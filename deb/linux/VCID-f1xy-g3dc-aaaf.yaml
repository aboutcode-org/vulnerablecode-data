summary: arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c in the Linux kernel through 4.13.5, when nested virtualisation
  is used, does not properly traverse guest pagetable entries to resolve a guest virtual
  address, which allows L1 guest OS users to execute arbitrary code on the host OS
  or cause a denial of service (incorrect index during page walking, and host OS crash),
  aka an "MMU potential stack buffer overrun."
