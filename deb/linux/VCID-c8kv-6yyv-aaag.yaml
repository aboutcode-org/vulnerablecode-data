summary: The nfs_can_extend_write function in fs/nfs/write.c in the Linux kernel before
  3.13.3 relies on a write delegation to extend a write operation without a certain
  up-to-date verification, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information
  from kernel memory in opportunistic circumstances by writing to a file in an NFS
  filesystem and then reading the same file.
