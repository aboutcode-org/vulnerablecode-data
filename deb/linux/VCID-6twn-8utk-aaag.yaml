summary: In the Linux kernel through 5.2.14 on the powerpc platform, a local user
  can read vector registers of other users' processes via an interrupt. To exploit
  the venerability, a local user starts a transaction (via the hardware transactional
  memory instruction tbegin) and then accesses vector registers. At some point, the
  vector registers will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux
  process, because MSR_TM_ACTIVE is misused in arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c.
