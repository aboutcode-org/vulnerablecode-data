summary: A flaw was found in the fix for CVE-2019-11135, in the Linux upstream kernel
  versions before 5.5 where, the way Intel CPUs handle speculative execution of instructions
  when a TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA) error occurs. When a guest is running on a host
  CPU affected by the TAA flaw (TAA_NO=0), but is not affected by the MDS issue (MDS_NO=1),
  the guest was to clear the affected buffers by using a VERW instruction mechanism.
  But when the MDS_NO=1 bit was exported to the guests, the guests did not use the
  VERW mechanism to clear the affected buffers. This issue affects guests running
  on Cascade Lake CPUs and requires that host has 'TSX' enabled. Confidentiality of
  data is the highest threat associated with this vulnerability.
