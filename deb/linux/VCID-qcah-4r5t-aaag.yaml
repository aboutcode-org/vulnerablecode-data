summary: The ksmbd server through 3.4.2, as used in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8,
  sometimes communicates in cleartext even though encryption has been enabled. This
  occurs because it sets the SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_ENCRYPTION flag when using the SMB 3.1.1
  protocol, which is a violation of the SMB protocol specification. When Windows 10
  detects this protocol violation, it disables encryption.
