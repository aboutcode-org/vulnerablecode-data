summary: The vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl function (accessible via DRM_IOCTL_VMW_GB_SURFACE_CREATE)
  in drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c in the Linux kernel through 4.11.4 defines
  a backup_handle variable but does not give it an initial value. If one attempts
  to create a GB surface, with a previously allocated DMA buffer to be used as a backup
  buffer, the backup_handle variable does not get written to and is then later returned
  to user space, allowing local users to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized
  kernel memory via a crafted ioctl call.
