summary: A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function logic
  of the LInux kernel that allows local users to create files for the XFS file-system
  with an unintended group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission
  bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group
  and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive
  permissions granted in case when they should not. This vulnerability is similar
  to the previous CVE-2018-13405 and adds the missed fix for the XFS.
