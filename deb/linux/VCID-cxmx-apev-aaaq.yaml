summary: A buffer overflow flaw was found, in versions from 2.6.34 to 5.2.x, in the
  way Linux kernel's vhost functionality that translates virtqueue buffers to IOVs,
  logged the buffer descriptors during migration. A privileged guest user able to
  pass descriptors with invalid length to the host when migration is underway, could
  use this flaw to increase their privileges on the host.
