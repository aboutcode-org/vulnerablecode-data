summary: The coredump implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.0.10 does not use
  locking or other mechanisms to prevent vma layout or vma flags changes while it
  runs, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of
  service, or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a race condition
  with mmget_not_zero or get_task_mm calls. This is related to fs/userfaultfd.c, mm/mmap.c,
  fs/proc/task_mmu.c, and drivers/infiniband/core/uverbs_main.c.
