summary: The bio_map_user_iov and bio_unmap_user functions in block/bio.c in the Linux
  kernel before 4.13.8 do unbalanced refcounting when a SCSI I/O vector has small
  consecutive buffers belonging to the same page. The bio_add_pc_page function merges
  them into one, but the page reference is never dropped. This causes a memory leak
  and possible system lockup (exploitable against the host OS by a guest OS user,
  if a SCSI disk is passed through to a virtual machine) due to an out-of-memory condition.
