summary: An issue was discovered in write_tpt_entry in drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb4/mem.c
  in the Linux kernel through 5.3.2. The cxgb4 driver is directly calling dma_map_single
  (a DMA function) from a stack variable. This could allow an attacker to trigger
  a Denial of Service, exploitable if this driver is used on an architecture for which
  this stack/DMA interaction has security relevance.
