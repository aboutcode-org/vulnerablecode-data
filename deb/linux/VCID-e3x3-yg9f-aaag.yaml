summary: The Linux kernel before 3.15.4 on Intel processors does not properly restrict
  use of a non-canonical value for the saved RIP address in the case of a system call
  that does not use IRET, which allows local users to leverage a race condition and
  gain privileges, or cause a denial of service (double fault), via a crafted application
  that makes ptrace and fork system calls.
