summary: 'Since Linux kernel version 3.2, the mremap() syscall performs TLB flushes
  after dropping pagetable locks. If a syscall such as ftruncate() removes entries
  from the pagetables of a task that is in the middle of mremap(), a stale TLB entry
  can remain for a short time that permits access to a physical page after it has
  been released back to the page allocator and reused. This is fixed in the following
  kernel versions: 4.9.135, 4.14.78, 4.18.16, 4.19.'
