summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of biovecs in versions
  before 5.9-rc7. A zero-length biovec request issued by the block subsystem could
  cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop, causing a denial of service. This flaw
  allows a local attacker with basic privileges to issue requests to a block device,
  resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
  to system availability.
