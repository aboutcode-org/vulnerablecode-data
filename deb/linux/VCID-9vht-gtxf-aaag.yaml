summary: arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.17.2
  on Intel processors does not ensure that the value in the CR4 control register remains
  the same after a VM entry, which allows host OS users to kill arbitrary processes
  or cause a denial of service (system disruption) by leveraging /dev/kvm access,
  as demonstrated by PR_SET_TSC prctl calls within a modified copy of QEMU.
