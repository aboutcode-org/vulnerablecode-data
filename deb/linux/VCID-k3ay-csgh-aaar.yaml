summary: "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the /proc/pid/syscall\
  \ functionality of Linux Kernel 5.1 Stable and 5.4.66. More specifically, this issue\
  \ has been introduced in v5.1-rc4 (commit 631b7abacd02b88f4b0795c08b54ad4fc3e7c7c0)\
  \ and is still present in v5.10-rc4, so it\u2019s likely that all versions in between\
  \ are affected. An attacker can read /proc/pid/syscall to trigger this vulnerability,\
  \ which leads to the kernel leaking memory contents."
