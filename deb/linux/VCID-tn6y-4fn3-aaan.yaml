summary: arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S in the Linux kernel before 3.19.2 does not prevent
  the TS_COMPAT flag from reaching a user-mode task, which might allow local users
  to bypass the seccomp or audit protection mechanism via a crafted application that
  uses the (1) fork or (2) close system call, as demonstrated by an attack against
  seccomp before 3.16.
