summary: The futex_wait function in kernel/futex.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37
  does not properly maintain a certain reference count during requeue operations,
  which allows local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system
  crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted application that triggers a zero
  count.
