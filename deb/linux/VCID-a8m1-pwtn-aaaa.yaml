summary: A race condition was found in the Linux kernels implementation of the floppy
  disk drive controller driver software. The impact of this issue is lessened by the
  fact that the default permissions on the floppy device (/dev/fd0) are restricted
  to root. If the permissions on the device have changed the impact changes greatly.
  In the default configuration root (or equivalent) permissions are required to attack
  this flaw.
