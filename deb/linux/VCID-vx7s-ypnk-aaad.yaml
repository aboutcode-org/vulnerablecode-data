summary: fs/namei.c in the Linux kernel before 5.5 has a may_create_in_sticky use-after-free,
  which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) or possibly obtain
  sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-d0cb50185ae9. One attack vector
  may be an open system call for a UNIX domain socket, if the socket is being moved
  to a new parent directory and its old parent directory is being removed.
