summary: Linux drivers/char/lp.c Out-of-Bounds Write. Due to a missing bounds check,
  and the fact that parport_ptr integer is static, a 'secure boot' kernel command
  line adversary (can happen due to bootloader vulns, e.g. Google Nexus 6's CVE-2016-10277,
  where due to a vulnerability the adversary has partial control over the command
  line) can overflow the parport_nr array in the following code, by appending many
  (>LP_NO) 'lp=none' arguments to the command line.
