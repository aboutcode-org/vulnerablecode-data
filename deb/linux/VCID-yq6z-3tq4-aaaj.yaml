summary: 'A backporting error was discovered in the Linux stable/longterm kernel 4.4.x
  through 4.4.190, 4.9.x through 4.9.190, 4.14.x through 4.14.141, 4.19.x through
  4.19.69, and 5.2.x through 5.2.11. Misuse of the upstream "x86/ptrace: Fix possible
  spectre-v1 in ptrace_get_debugreg()" commit reintroduced the Spectre vulnerability
  that it aimed to eliminate. This occurred because the backport process depends on
  cherry picking specific commits, and because two (correctly ordered) code lines
  were swapped.'
