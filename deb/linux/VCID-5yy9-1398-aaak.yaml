summary: An infinite loop issue was found in the vhost_net kernel module in Linux
  Kernel up to and including v5.1-rc6, while handling incoming packets in handle_rx().
  It could occur if one end sends packets faster than the other end can process them.
  A guest user, maybe remote one, could use this flaw to stall the vhost_net kernel
  thread, resulting in a DoS scenario.
