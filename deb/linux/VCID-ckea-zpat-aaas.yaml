summary: The usb_destroy_configuration function in drivers/usb/core/config.c in the
  USB core subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.14.5 does not consider the maximum
  number of configurations and interfaces before attempting to release resources,
  which allows local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write access)
  or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device.
