summary: The NFSv4 server in the Linux kernel before 4.11.3 does not properly validate
  the layout type when processing the NFSv4 pNFS GETDEVICEINFO or LAYOUTGET operand
  in a UDP packet from a remote attacker. This type value is uninitialized upon encountering
  certain error conditions. This value is used as an array index for dereferencing,
  which leads to an OOPS and eventually a DoS of knfsd and a soft-lockup of the whole
  system.
