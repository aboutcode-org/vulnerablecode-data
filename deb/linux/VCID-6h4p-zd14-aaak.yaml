summary: A signal access-control issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.6.5,
  aka CID-7395ea4e65c2. Because exec_id in include/linux/sched.h is only 32 bits,
  an integer overflow can interfere with a do_notify_parent protection mechanism.
  A child process can send an arbitrary signal to a parent process in a different
  security domain. Exploitation limitations include the amount of elapsed time before
  an integer overflow occurs, and the lack of scenarios where signals to a parent
  process present a substantial operational threat.
