summary: fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 does not properly restrict
  clearing MNT_NODEV, MNT_NOSUID, and MNT_NOEXEC and changing MNT_ATIME_MASK during
  a remount of a bind mount, which allows local users to gain privileges, interfere
  with backups and auditing on systems that had atime enabled, or cause a denial of
  service (excessive filesystem updating) on systems that had atime disabled via a
  "mount -o remount" command within a user namespace.
