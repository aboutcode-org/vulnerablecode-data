summary: A race condition in Linux kernel SCTP sockets (net/sctp/socket.c) before
  5.12-rc8 can lead to kernel privilege escalation from the context of a network service
  or an unprivileged process. If sctp_destroy_sock is called without sock_net(sk)->sctp.addr_wq_lock
  then an element is removed from the auto_asconf_splist list without any proper locking.
  This can be exploited by an attacker with network service privileges to escalate
  to root or from the context of an unprivileged user directly if a BPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE
  is attached which denies creation of some SCTP socket.
