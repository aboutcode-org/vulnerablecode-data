summary: "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.6.2.\
  \ mpol_parse_str in mm/mempolicy.c has a stack-based out-of-bounds write because\
  \ an empty nodelist is mishandled during mount option parsing, aka CID-aa9f7d5172fa.\
  \ NOTE: Someone in the security community disagrees that this is a vulnerability\
  \ because the issue \u201Cis a bug in parsing mount options which can only be specified\
  \ by a privileged user, so triggering the bug does not grant any powers not already\
  \ held.\u201D."
