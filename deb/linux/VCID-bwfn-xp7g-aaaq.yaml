summary: arch/x86/kernel/tls.c in the Thread Local Storage (TLS) implementation in
  the Linux kernel through 3.18.1 allows local users to bypass the espfix protection
  mechanism, and consequently makes it easier for local users to bypass the ASLR protection
  mechanism, via a crafted application that makes a set_thread_area system call and
  later reads a 16-bit value.
