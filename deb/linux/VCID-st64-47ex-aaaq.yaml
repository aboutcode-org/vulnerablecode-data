summary: The PCI backend driver in Xen, when running on an x86 system and using Linux
  3.1.x through 4.3.x as the driver domain, allows local guest administrators to hit
  BUG conditions and cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host
  OS crash) by leveraging a system with access to a passed-through MSI or MSI-X capable
  physical PCI device and a crafted sequence of XEN_PCI_OP_* operations, aka "Linux
  pciback missing sanity checks."
