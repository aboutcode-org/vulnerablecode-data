summary: The xfs_da3_fixhashpath function in fs/xfs/xfs_da_btree.c in the xfs implementation
  in the Linux kernel before 3.14.2 does not properly compare btree hash values, which
  allows local users to cause a denial of service (filesystem corruption, and OOPS
  or panic) via operations on directories that have hash collisions, as demonstrated
  by rmdir operations.
