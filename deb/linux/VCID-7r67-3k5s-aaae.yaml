summary: The Linux Kernel imposes a size restriction on the arguments and environmental
  strings passed through RLIMIT_STACK/RLIM_INFINITY (1/4 of the size), but does not
  take the argument and environment pointers into account, which allows attackers
  to bypass this limitation. This affects Linux Kernel versions 4.11.5 and earlier.
  It appears that this feature was introduced in the Linux Kernel version 2.6.23.
