summary: A flaw was found in Linux kernel's KVM virtualization subsystem. The VMX
  code does not restore the GDT.LIMIT to the previous host value, but instead sets
  it to 64KB. With a corrupted GDT limit a host's userspace code has an ability to
  place malicious entries in the GDT, particularly to the per-cpu variables. An attacker
  can use this to escalate their privileges.
