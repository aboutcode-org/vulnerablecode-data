summary: A flaw was found in the io-workqueue implementation in the Linux kernel versions
  prior to 5.15-rc1. The kernel can panic when an improper cancellation operation
  triggers the submission of new io-uring operations during a shortage of free space.
  This flaw allows a local user with permissions to execute io-uring requests to possibly
  crash the system.
