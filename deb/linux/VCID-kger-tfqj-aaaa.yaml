summary: '** DISPUTED ** A memory leak in the fsl_lpspi_probe() function in drivers/spi/spi-fsl-lpspi.c
  in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service
  (memory consumption) by triggering pm_runtime_get_sync() failures, aka CID-057b8945f78f.
  NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this because an attacker cannot realistically
  control these failures at probe time.'
