summary: 'In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles
  the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship,
  which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with
  a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops privileges and calls execve
  (potentially allowing control by an attacker). One contributing factor is an object
  lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic). Another contributing factor is incorrect
  marking of a ptrace relationship as privileged, which is exploitable through (for
  example) Polkit''s pkexec helper with PTRACE_TRACEME. NOTE: SELinux deny_ptrace
  might be a usable workaround in some environments.'
