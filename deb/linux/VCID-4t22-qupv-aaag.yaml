summary: The scm_check_creds function in net/core/scm.c in the Linux kernel before
  3.8.6 does not properly enforce capability requirements for controlling the PID
  value associated with a UNIX domain socket, which allows local users to bypass intended
  access restrictions by leveraging the time interval during which a user namespace
  has been created but a PID namespace has not been created.
