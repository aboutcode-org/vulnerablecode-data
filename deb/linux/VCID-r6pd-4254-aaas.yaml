summary: "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s implementation of the invert\
  \ video code on VGA consoles when a local attacker attempts to resize the console,\
  \ calling an ioctl VT_RESIZE, which causes an out-of-bounds write to occur. This\
  \ flaw allows a local user with access to the VGA console to crash the system, potentially\
  \ escalating their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability\
  \ is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
