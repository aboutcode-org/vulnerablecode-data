summary: 'An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.19.3. crypto_report_one()
  and related functions in crypto/crypto_user.c (the crypto user configuration API)
  do not fully initialize structures that are copied to userspace, potentially leaking
  sensitive memory to user programs. NOTE: this is a CVE-2013-2547 regression but
  with easier exploitability because the attacker does not need a capability (however,
  the system must have the CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER kconfig option).'
