summary: The netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.9 mishandles IPv6 reassembly,
  which allows local users to cause a denial of service (integer overflow, out-of-bounds
  write, and GPF) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application
  that makes socket, connect, and writev system calls, related to net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_conntrack_reasm.c
  and net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_defrag_ipv6_hooks.c.
