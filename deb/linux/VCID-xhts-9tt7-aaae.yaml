summary: 'Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA
  information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities
  correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged
  guests, typically referred to as "driver domains". Running PV backends in driver
  domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets compromised,
  it doesn''t have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver
  domain could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading
  to a Denial of Service in the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated
  amounts of time. There are three affected backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711
  * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch 3, CVE-2021-28713'
