severities: []
summary: arch/s390/kernel/ptrace.c in the Linux kernel before 3.15.8 on the s390 platform
  does not properly restrict address-space control operations in PTRACE_POKEUSR_AREA
  requests, which allows local users to obtain read and write access to kernel memory
  locations, and consequently gain privileges, via a crafted application that makes
  a ptrace system call.
