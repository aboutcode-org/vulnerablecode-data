summary: 'Linux kernel: Exploitable memory corruption due to UFO to non-UFO path switch.
  When building a UFO packet with MSG_MORE __ip_append_data() calls ip_ufo_append_data()
  to append. However in between two send() calls, the append path can be switched
  from UFO to non-UFO one, which leads to a memory corruption. In case UFO packet
  lengths exceeds MTU, copy = maxfraglen - skb->len becomes negative on the non-UFO
  path and the branch to allocate new skb is taken. This triggers fragmentation and
  computation of fraggap = skb_prev->len - maxfraglen. Fraggap can exceed MTU, causing
  copy = datalen - transhdrlen - fraggap to become negative. Subsequently skb_copy_and_csum_bits()
  writes out-of-bounds. A similar issue is present in IPv6 code. The bug was introduced
  in e89e9cf539a2 ("[IPv4/IPv6]: UFO Scatter-gather approach") on Oct 18 2005.'
