summary: Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86
  (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015
  by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77
  in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE
  enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will
  attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm->mmap_base.
  Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate
  sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD
  segment is mapped below mm->mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up
  being mapped above mm->mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between
  the stack and the binary.
