summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.11. The BPF subsystem
  does not properly consider that resolved_ids and resolved_sizes are intentionally
  uninitialized in the vmlinux BPF Type Format (BTF), which can cause a system crash
  upon an unexpected access attempt (in map_create in kernel/bpf/syscall.c or check_btf_info
  in kernel/bpf/verifier.c), aka CID-350a5c4dd245.
