summary: An out-of-bounds memory write issue was found in the Linux Kernel, version
  3.13 through 5.4, in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled the 'KVM_GET_EMULATED_CPUID'
  ioctl(2) request to get CPUID features emulated by the KVM hypervisor. A user or
  process able to access the '/dev/kvm' device could use this flaw to crash the system,
  resulting in a denial of service.
