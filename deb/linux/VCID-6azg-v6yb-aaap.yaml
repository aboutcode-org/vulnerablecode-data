summary: Shiftfs, an out-of-tree stacking file system included in Ubuntu Linux kernels,
  did not properly handle faults occurring during copy_from_user() correctly. These
  could lead to either a double-free situation or memory not being freed at all. An
  attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion)
  or gain privileges via executing arbitrary code. AKA ZDI-CAN-13562.
