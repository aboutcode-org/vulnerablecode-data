summary: In core_info_read and inst_info_read in all Android releases from CAF using
  the Linux kernel, variable "dbg_buf", "dbg_buf->curr" and "dbg_buf->filled_size"
  could be modified by different threads at the same time, but they are not protected
  with mutex or locks. Buffer overflow is possible on race conditions. "buffer->curr"
  itself could also be overwritten, which means that it may point to anywhere of kernel
  memory (for write).
