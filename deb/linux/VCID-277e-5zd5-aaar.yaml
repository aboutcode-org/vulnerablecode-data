summary: An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write flaw was found in list_devices in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c
  in the Multi-device driver module in the Linux kernel before 5.12. A bound check
  failure allows an attacker with special user (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) privilege to gain access
  to out-of-bounds memory leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information.
  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
