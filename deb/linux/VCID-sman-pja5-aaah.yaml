summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of some networking
  protocols in IPsec, such as VXLAN and GENEVE tunnels over IPv6. When an encrypted
  tunnel is created between two hosts, the kernel isn't correctly routing tunneled
  data over the encrypted link; rather sending the data unencrypted. This would allow
  anyone in between the two endpoints to read the traffic unencrypted. The main threat
  from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.
