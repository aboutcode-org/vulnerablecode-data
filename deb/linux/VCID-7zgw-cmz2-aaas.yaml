summary: Integer overflow in the LZ4 algorithm implementation, as used in Yann Collet
  LZ4 before r118 and in the lz4_uncompress function in lib/lz4/lz4_decompress.c in
  the Linux kernel before 3.15.2, on 32-bit platforms might allow context-dependent
  attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via a crafted Literal Run that would be improperly handled by programs
  not complying with an API limitation, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-4715.
