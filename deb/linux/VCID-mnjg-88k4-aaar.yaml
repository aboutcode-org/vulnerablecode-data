summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernels SELinux LSM hook implementation before
  version 5.7, where it incorrectly assumed that an skb would only contain a single
  netlink message. The hook would incorrectly only validate the first netlink message
  in the skb and allow or deny the rest of the messages within the skb with the granted
  permission without further processing.
