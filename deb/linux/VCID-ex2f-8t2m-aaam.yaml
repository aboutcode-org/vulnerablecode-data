summary: A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting the Secure Encrypted
  Virtualization-Encrypted State (SEV-ES). A KVM guest using SEV-ES can trigger out-of-bounds
  reads and writes in the host kernel via a malicious VMGEXIT for a string I/O instruction
  (for example, outs or ins) using the exit reason SVM_EXIT_IOIO. This issue results
  in a crash of the entire system or a potential guest-to-host escape scenario.
