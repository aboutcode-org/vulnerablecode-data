summary: Jonathan Looney discovered that the Linux kernel default MSS is hard-coded
  to 48 bytes. This allows a remote peer to fragment TCP resend queues significantly
  more than if a larger MSS were enforced. A remote attacker could use this to cause
  a denial of service. This has been fixed in stable kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182,
  4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11, and is fixed in commits 967c05aee439e6e5d7d805e195b3a20ef5c433d6
  and 5f3e2bf008c2221478101ee72f5cb4654b9fc363.
