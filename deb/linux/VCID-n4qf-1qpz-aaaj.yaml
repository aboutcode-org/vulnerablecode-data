summary: 'The (1) BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR and (2) BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR_NEST extension implementations
  in the sk_run_filter function in net/core/filter.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3
  do not check whether a certain length value is sufficiently large, which allows
  local users to cause a denial of service (integer underflow and system crash) via
  crafted BPF instructions. NOTE: the affected code was moved to the __skb_get_nlattr
  and __skb_get_nlattr_nest functions before the vulnerability was announced.'
