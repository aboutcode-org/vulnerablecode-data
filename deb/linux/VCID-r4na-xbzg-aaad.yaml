summary: The xfrm_replay_verify_len function in net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c in the Linux
  kernel through 4.10.6 does not validate certain size data after an XFRM_MSG_NEWAE
  update, which allows local users to obtain root privileges or cause a denial of
  service (heap-based out-of-bounds access) by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability,
  as demonstrated during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2017 for the Ubuntu 16.10
  linux-image-* package 4.8.0.41.52.
