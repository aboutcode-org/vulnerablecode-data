summary: 'The eBPF ALU32 bounds tracking for bitwise ops (AND, OR and XOR) in the
  Linux kernel did not properly update 32-bit bounds, which could be turned into out
  of bounds reads and writes in the Linux kernel and therefore, arbitrary code execution.
  This issue was fixed via commit 049c4e13714e ("bpf: Fix alu32 const subreg bound
  tracking on bitwise operations") (v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels
  in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. The AND/OR issues were introduced by commit
  3f50f132d840 ("bpf: Verifier, do explicit ALU32 bounds tracking") (5.7-rc1) and
  the XOR variant was introduced by 2921c90d4718 ("bpf:Fix a verifier failure with
  xor") ( 5.10-rc1).'
