summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.8.9. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and
  WPA3 implementations reassemble fragments even though some of them were sent in
  plaintext. This vulnerability can be abused to inject packets and/or exfiltrate
  selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP,
  or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used.
