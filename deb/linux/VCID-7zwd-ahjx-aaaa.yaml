summary: 'An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3, as used with
  Xen PV. A certain part of the netback driver lacks necessary treatment of errors
  such as failed memory allocations (as a result of changes to the handling of grant
  mapping errors). A host OS denial of service may occur during misbehavior of a networking
  frontend driver. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-26931.'
