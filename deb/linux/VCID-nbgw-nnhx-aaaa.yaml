summary: An out-of-bounds access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation
  of the eBPF code verifier in the way a user running the eBPF script calls dev_map_init_map
  or sock_map_alloc. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or possibly
  escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
  integrity, as well as system availability.
