summary: A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's EBPF verifier when handling
  internal data structures. Internal memory locations could be returned to userspace.
  A local attacker with the permissions to insert eBPF code to the kernel can use
  this to leak internal kernel memory details defeating some of the exploit mitigations
  in place for the kernel.
