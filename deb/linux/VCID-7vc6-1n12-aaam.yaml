summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vfio interface implementation that
  permits violation of the user's locked memory limit. If a device is bound to a vfio
  driver, such as vfio-pci, and the local attacker is administratively granted ownership
  of the device, it may cause a system memory exhaustion and thus a denial of service
  (DoS). Versions 3.10, 4.14 and 4.18 are vulnerable.
