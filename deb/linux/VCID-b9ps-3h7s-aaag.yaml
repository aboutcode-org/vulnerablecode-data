summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's NFS41+ subsystem. NFS41+ shares mounted
  in different network namespaces at the same time can make bc_svc_process() use wrong
  back-channel IDs and cause a use-after-free vulnerability. Thus a malicious container
  user can cause a host kernel memory corruption and a system panic. Due to the nature
  of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out.
