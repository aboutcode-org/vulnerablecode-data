summary: The implementation of certain splice_write file operations in the Linux kernel
  before 3.16 does not enforce a restriction on the maximum size of a single file,
  which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
  have unspecified other impact via a crafted splice system call, as demonstrated
  by use of a file descriptor associated with an ext4 filesystem.
