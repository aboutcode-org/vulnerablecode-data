summary: The networking implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.3.3, as used
  in Android and other products, does not validate protocol identifiers for certain
  protocol families, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL function
  pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly gain privileges by leveraging
  CLONE_NEWUSER support to execute a crafted SOCK_RAW application.
