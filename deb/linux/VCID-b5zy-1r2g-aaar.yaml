summary: In the Linux kernel before 4.17, a local attacker able to set attributes
  on an xfs filesystem could make this filesystem non-operational until the next mount
  by triggering an unchecked error condition during an xfs attribute change, because
  xfs_attr_shortform_addname in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr.c mishandles ATTR_REPLACE operations
  with conversion of an attr from short to long form.
