summary: The Linux kernel through 5.3.13 has a start_offset+size Integer Overflow
  in cpia2_remap_buffer in drivers/media/usb/cpia2/cpia2_core.c because cpia2 has
  its own mmap implementation. This allows local users (with /dev/video0 access) to
  obtain read and write permissions on kernel physical pages, which can possibly result
  in a privilege escalation.
