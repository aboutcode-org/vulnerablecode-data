summary: An out-of-bounds access issue was found in the Linux kernel, all versions
  through 5.3, in the way Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor implements the Coalesced MMIO
  write operation. It operates on an MMIO ring buffer 'struct kvm_coalesced_mmio'
  object, wherein write indices 'ring->first' and 'ring->last' value could be supplied
  by a host user-space process. An unprivileged host user or process with access to
  '/dev/kvm' device could use this flaw to crash the host kernel, resulting in a denial
  of service or potentially escalating privileges on the system.
