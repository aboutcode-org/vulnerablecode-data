summary: crypto/algif_skcipher.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4.2 does not verify
  that a setkey operation has been performed on an AF_ALG socket before an accept
  system call is processed, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
  (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted application that does
  not supply a key, related to the lrw_crypt function in crypto/lrw.c.
