summary: A security flaw was found in the ip_frag_reasm() function in net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c
  in the Linux kernel from 4.19-rc1 to 4.19-rc3 inclusive, which can cause a later
  system crash in ip_do_fragment(). With certain non-default, but non-rare, configuration
  of a victim host, an attacker can trigger this crash remotely, thus leading to a
  remote denial-of-service.
