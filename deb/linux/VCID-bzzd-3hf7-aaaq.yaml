summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.9.x through 5.11.3, as used
  with Xen. In some less-common configurations, an x86 PV guest OS user can crash
  a Dom0 or driver domain via a large amount of I/O activity. The issue relates to
  misuse of guest physical addresses when a configuration has CONFIG_XEN_UNPOPULATED_ALLOC
  but not CONFIG_XEN_BALLOON_MEMORY_HOTPLUG.
