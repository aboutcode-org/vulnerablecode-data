summary: 'The cookie feature in the packet action API implementation in net/sched/act_api.c
  in the Linux kernel 4.11.x through 4.11-rc7 mishandles the tb nlattr array, which
  allows local users to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access and
  refcount underflow, and system hang or crash) or possibly have unspecified other
  impact via "tc filter add" commands in certain contexts. NOTE: this does not affect
  stable kernels, such as 4.10.x, from kernel.org.'
