summary: An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in fs/f2fs/node.c in
  the f2fs module in the Linux kernel in versions before 5.12.0-rc4. A bounds check
  failure allows a local attacker to gain access to out-of-bounds memory leading to
  a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from
  this vulnerability is to system availability.
