summary: 'An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.2 through 5.10.16, as used
  by Xen. Grant mapping operations often occur in batch hypercalls, where a number
  of operations are done in a single hypercall, the success or failure of each one
  is reported to the backend driver, and the backend driver then loops over the results,
  performing follow-up actions based on the success or failure of each operation.
  Unfortunately, when running in PV mode, the Linux backend drivers mishandle this:
  Some errors are ignored, effectively implying their success from the success of
  related batch elements. In other cases, errors resulting from one batch element
  lead to further batch elements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to
  not be possible to properly unmap upon error recovery. Only systems with Linux backends
  running in PV mode are vulnerable. Linux backends run in HVM / PVH modes are not
  vulnerable. This affects arch/*/xen/p2m.c and drivers/xen/gntdev.c.'
