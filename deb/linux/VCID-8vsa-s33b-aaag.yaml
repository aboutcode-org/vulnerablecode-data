summary: An issue was discovered in the kernel in NetBSD 7.1. An Access Point (AP)
  forwards EAPOL frames to other clients even though the sender has not yet successfully
  authenticated to the AP. This might be abused in projected Wi-Fi networks to launch
  denial-of-service attacks against connected clients and makes it easier to exploit
  other vulnerabilities in connected clients.
