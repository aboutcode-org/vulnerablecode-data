summary: In the Linux kernel 4.15.x through 4.19.x before 4.19.2, map_write() in kernel/user_namespace.c
  allows privilege escalation because it mishandles nested user namespaces with more
  than 5 UID or GID ranges. A user who has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in an affected user namespace
  can bypass access controls on resources outside the namespace, as demonstrated by
  reading /etc/shadow. This occurs because an ID transformation takes place properly
  for the namespaced-to-kernel direction but not for the kernel-to-namespaced direction.
