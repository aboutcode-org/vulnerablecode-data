summary: The hub_activate function in drivers/usb/core/hub.c in the Linux kernel before
  4.3.5 does not properly maintain a hub-interface data structure, which allows physically
  proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory access and system
  crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by unplugging a USB hub device.
