summary: The PCI backend driver in Xen, when running on an x86 system and using Linux
  3.1.x through 4.3.x as the driver domain, allows local guest administrators to generate
  a continuous stream of WARN messages and cause a denial of service (disk consumption)
  by leveraging a system with access to a passed-through MSI or MSI-X capable physical
  PCI device and XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi operations, aka "Linux pciback missing sanity
  checks."
