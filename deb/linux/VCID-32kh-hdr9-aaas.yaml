summary: The CONFIG_STRICT_MEMORY_RWX implementation for the Linux kernel 3.x, as
  used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices
  and other products, does not properly consider certain memory sections, which makes
  it easier for attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the
  presence of RWX memory at a fixed location.
