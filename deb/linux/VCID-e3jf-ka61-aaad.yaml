summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.4 and 5.5 through 5.5.6 on
  the AArch64 architecture. It ignores the top byte in the address passed to the brk
  system call, potentially moving the memory break downwards when the application
  expects it to move upwards, aka CID-dcde237319e6. This has been observed to cause
  heap corruption with the GNU C Library malloc implementation.
