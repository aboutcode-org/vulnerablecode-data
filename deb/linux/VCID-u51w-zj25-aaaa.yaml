summary: In the Linux kernel 5.5.0 and newer, the bpf verifier (kernel/bpf/verifier.c)
  did not properly restrict the register bounds for 32-bit operations, leading to
  out-of-bounds reads and writes in kernel memory. The vulnerability also affects
  the Linux 5.4 stable series, starting with v5.4.7, as the introducing commit was
  backported to that branch. This vulnerability was fixed in 5.6.1, 5.5.14, and 5.4.29.
