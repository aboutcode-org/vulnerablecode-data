summary: The sctp_assoc_update function in net/sctp/associola.c in the Linux kernel
  through 3.15.8, when SCTP authentication is enabled, allows remote attackers to
  cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) by starting to establish
  an association between two endpoints immediately after an exchange of INIT and INIT
  ACK chunks to establish an earlier association between these endpoints in the opposite
  direction.
