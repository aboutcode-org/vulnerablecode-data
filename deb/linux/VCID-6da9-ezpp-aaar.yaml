summary: The raw_cmd_copyout function in drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel
  through 3.14.3 does not properly restrict access to certain pointers during processing
  of an FDRAWCMD ioctl call, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information
  from kernel heap memory by leveraging write access to a /dev/fd device.
