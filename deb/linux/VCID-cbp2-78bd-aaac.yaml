summary: An issue was discovered in can_can_gw_rcv in net/can/gw.c in the Linux kernel
  through 4.19.13. The CAN frame modification rules allow bitwise logical operations
  that can be also applied to the can_dlc field. The privileged user "root" with CAP_NET_ADMIN
  can create a CAN frame modification rule that makes the data length code a higher
  value than the available CAN frame data size. In combination with a configured checksum
  calculation where the result is stored relatively to the end of the data (e.g. cgw_csum_xor_rel)
  the tail of the skb (e.g. frag_list pointer in skb_shared_info) can be rewritten
  which finally can cause a system crash. Because of a missing check, the CAN drivers
  may write arbitrary content beyond the data registers in the CAN controller's I/O
  memory when processing can-gw manipulated outgoing frames.
