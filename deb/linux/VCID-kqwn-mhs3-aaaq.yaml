summary: The ip_cmsg_recv_checksum function in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux
  kernel before 4.10.1 has incorrect expectations about skb data layout, which allows
  local users to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read) or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via crafted system calls, as demonstrated by use of the MSG_MORE flag
  in conjunction with loopback UDP transmission.
