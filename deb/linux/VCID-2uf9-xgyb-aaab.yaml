summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 2.6.39 through 5.10.16, as used
  in Xen. Block, net, and SCSI backends consider certain errors a plain bug, deliberately
  causing a kernel crash. For errors potentially being at least under the influence
  of guests (such as out of memory conditions), it isn't correct to assume a plain
  bug. Memory allocations potentially causing such crashes occur only when Linux is
  running in PV mode, though. This affects drivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c and
  drivers/xen/xen-scsiback.c.
