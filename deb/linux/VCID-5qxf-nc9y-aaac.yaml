summary: In shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to the Linux kernel included in the Ubuntu
  5.0 and 5.3 kernel series, shiftfs_btrfs_ioctl_fd_replace() calls fdget(oldfd),
  then without further checks passes the resulting file* into shiftfs_real_fdget(),
  which casts file->private_data, a void* that points to a filesystem-dependent type,
  to a "struct shiftfs_file_info *". As the private_data is not required to be a pointer,
  an attacker can use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary
  code.
