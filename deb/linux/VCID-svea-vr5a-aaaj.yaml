summary: '** DISPUTED ** In the Linux kernel 4.19.83, there is a use-after-free (read)
  in the debugfs_remove function in fs/debugfs/inode.c (which is used to remove a
  file or directory in debugfs that was previously created with a call to another
  debugfs function such as debugfs_create_file). NOTE: Linux kernel developers dispute
  this issue as not being an issue with debugfs, instead this is an issue with misuse
  of debugfs within blktrace.'
