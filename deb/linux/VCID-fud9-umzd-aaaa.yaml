summary: A flaw was found affecting the Linux kernel before version 4.17. By mmap()ing
  a FUSE-backed file onto a process's memory containing command line arguments (or
  environment strings), an attacker can cause utilities from psutils or procps (such
  as ps, w) or any other program which makes a read() call to the /proc/<pid>/cmdline
  (or /proc/<pid>/environ) files to block indefinitely (denial of service) or for
  some controlled time (as a synchronization primitive for other attacks).
