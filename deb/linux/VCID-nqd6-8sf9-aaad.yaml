summary: In shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to the Linux kernel included in the Ubuntu
  5.0 and 5.3 kernel series, several locations which shift ids translate user/group
  ids before performing operations in the lower filesystem were translating them into
  init_user_ns, whereas they should have been translated into the s_user_ns for the
  lower filesystem. This resulted in using ids other than the intended ones in the
  lower fs, which likely did not map into the shifts s_user_ns. A local attacker could
  use this to possibly bypass discretionary access control permissions.
