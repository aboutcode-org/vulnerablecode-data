summary: The ext4_orphan_del function in fs/ext4/namei.c in the Linux kernel before
  3.7.3 does not properly handle orphan-list entries for non-journal filesystems,
  which allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (system
  hang) via a crafted filesystem on removable media, as demonstrated by the e2fsprogs
  tests/f_orphan_extents_inode/image.gz test.
