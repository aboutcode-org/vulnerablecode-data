summary: The Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.19 does not ensure
  that the visible xattr state is consistent with a requested replacement, which allows
  local users to bypass intended ACL settings and gain privileges via standard filesystem
  operations (1) during an xattr-replacement time window, related to a race condition,
  or (2) after an xattr-replacement attempt that fails because the data does not fit.
