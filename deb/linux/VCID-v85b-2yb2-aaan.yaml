summary: kernel KVM before versions kernel 4.16, kernel 4.16-rc7, kernel 4.17-rc1,
  kernel 4.17-rc2 and kernel 4.17-rc3 is vulnerable to a flaw in the way the Linux
  kernel's KVM hypervisor handled exceptions delivered after a stack switch operation
  via Mov SS or Pop SS instructions. During the stack switch operation, the processor
  did not deliver interrupts and exceptions, rather they are delivered once the first
  instruction after the stack switch is executed. An unprivileged KVM guest user could
  use this flaw to crash the guest or, potentially, escalate their privileges in the
  guest.
