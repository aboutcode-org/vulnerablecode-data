summary: An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WEP,
  WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations accept second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments
  even when sent in plaintext and process them as full unfragmented frames. An adversary
  can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration.
