summary: A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem in arch/x86/kvm/lapic.c
  kvm_free_lapic when a failure allocation was detected. In this flaw the KVM subsystem

  construction, which allows an attacker with special user privilege to cause a denial
  of service. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.15 rc7.
