summary: 'On Linux running on PowerPC hardware (Power8 or later) a user process can
  craft a signal frame and then do a sigreturn so that the kernel will take an exception
  (interrupt), and use the r1 value *from the signal frame* as the kernel stack pointer.
  As part of the exception entry the content of the signal frame is written to the
  kernel stack, allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary locations with arbitrary
  values. The exception handling does produce an oops, and a panic if panic_on_oops=1,
  but only after kernel memory has been over written. This flaw was introduced in
  commit: "5d176f751ee3 (powerpc: tm: Enable transactional memory (TM) lazily for
  userspace)" which was merged upstream into v4.9-rc1. Please note that kernels built
  with CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n are not vulnerable.'
