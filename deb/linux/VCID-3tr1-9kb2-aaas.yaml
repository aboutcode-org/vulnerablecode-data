summary: The Linux kernel through 3.14.5 does not properly consider the presence of
  hugetlb entries, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
  or system crash) by accessing certain memory locations, as demonstrated by triggering
  a race condition via numa_maps read operations during hugepage migration, related
  to fs/proc/task_mmu.c and mm/mempolicy.c.
