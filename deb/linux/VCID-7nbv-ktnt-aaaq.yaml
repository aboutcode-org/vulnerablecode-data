summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.8. A use-after-free
  in selinux_ptrace_traceme (aka the SELinux handler for PTRACE_TRACEME) could be
  used by local attackers to cause memory corruption and escalate privileges, aka
  CID-a3727a8bac0a. This occurs because of an attempt to access the subjective credentials
  of another task.
