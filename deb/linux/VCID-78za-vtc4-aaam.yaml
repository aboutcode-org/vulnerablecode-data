summary: The snd_msndmidi_input_read function in sound/isa/msnd/msnd_midi.c in the
  Linux kernel through 4.11.7 allows local users to cause a denial of service (over-boundary
  access) or possibly have unspecified other impact by changing the value of a message
  queue head pointer between two kernel reads of that value, aka a "double fetch"
  vulnerability.
