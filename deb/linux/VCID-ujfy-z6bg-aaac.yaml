summary: In the AppleTalk subsystem in the Linux kernel before 5.1, there is a potential
  NULL pointer dereference because register_snap_client may return NULL. This will
  lead to denial of service in net/appletalk/aarp.c and net/appletalk/ddp.c, as demonstrated
  by unregister_snap_client, aka CID-9804501fa122.
