summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.11 through 5.10.16, as used
  by Xen. To service requests to the PV backend, the driver maps grant references
  provided by the frontend. In this process, errors may be encountered. In one case,
  an error encountered earlier might be discarded by later processing, resulting in
  the caller assuming successful mapping, and hence subsequent operations trying to
  access space that wasn't mapped. In another case, internal state would be insufficiently
  updated, preventing safe recovery from the error. This affects drivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c.
