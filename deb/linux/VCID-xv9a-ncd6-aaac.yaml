summary: 'The BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR_NEST extension implementation in the sk_run_filter
  function in net/core/filter.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 uses the reverse
  order in a certain subtraction, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
  (over-read and system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. NOTE: the affected code
  was moved to the __skb_get_nlattr_nest function before the vulnerability was announced.'
