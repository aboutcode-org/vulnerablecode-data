summary: fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9 does not restrict how many
  mounts may exist in a mount namespace, which allows local users to cause a denial
  of service (memory consumption and deadlock) via MS_BIND mount system calls, as
  demonstrated by a loop that triggers exponential growth in the number of mounts.
