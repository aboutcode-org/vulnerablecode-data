summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of RDMA over infiniband.
  An attacker with a privileged local account can leak kernel stack information when
  issuing commands to the /dev/infiniband/rdma_cm device node. While this access is
  unlikely to leak sensitive user information, it can be further used to defeat existing
  kernel protection mechanisms.
