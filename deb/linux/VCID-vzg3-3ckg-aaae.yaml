summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. vbg_misc_device_ioctl()
  in drivers/virt/vboxguest/vboxguest_linux.c reads the same user data twice with
  copy_from_user. The header part of the user data is double-fetched, and a malicious
  user thread can tamper with the critical variables (hdr.size_in and hdr.size_out)
  in the header between the two fetches because of a race condition, leading to severe
  kernel errors, such as buffer over-accesses. This bug can cause a local denial of
  service and information leakage.
