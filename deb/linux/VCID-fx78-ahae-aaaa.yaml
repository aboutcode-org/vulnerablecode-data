summary: In net/socket.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.1, there is a race condition
  between fchownat and close in cases where they target the same socket file descriptor,
  related to the sock_close and sockfs_setattr functions. fchownat does not increment
  the file descriptor reference count, which allows close to set the socket to NULL
  during fchownat's execution, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and system crash.
