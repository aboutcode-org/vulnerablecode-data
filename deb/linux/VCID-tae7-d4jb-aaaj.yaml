summary: Jonathan Looney discovered that the TCP retransmission queue implementation
  in tcp_fragment in the Linux kernel could be fragmented when handling certain TCP
  Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) sequences. A remote attacker could use this to cause
  a denial of service. This has been fixed in stable kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182,
  4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11, and is fixed in commit f070ef2ac66716357066b683fb0baf55f8191a2e.
