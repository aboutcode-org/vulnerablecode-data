summary: A race problem was seen in the vt_k_ioctl in drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c in
  the Linux kernel, which may cause an out of bounds read in vt as the write access
  to vc_mode is not protected by lock-in vt_ioctl (KDSETMDE). The highest threat from
  this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.
