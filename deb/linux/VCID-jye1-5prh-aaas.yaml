summary: In shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to the Linux kernel included in the Ubuntu
  5.0 and 5.3 kernel series, shiftfs_btrfs_ioctl_fd_replace() installs an fd referencing
  a file from the lower filesystem without taking an additional reference to that
  file. After the btrfs ioctl completes this fd is closed, which then puts a reference
  to that file, leading to a refcount underflow.
