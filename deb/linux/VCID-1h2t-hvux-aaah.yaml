summary: It was found that the net_dma code in tcp_recvmsg() in the 2.6.32 kernel
  as shipped in RHEL6 is thread-unsafe. So an unprivileged multi-threaded userspace
  application calling recvmsg() for the same network socket in parallel executed on
  ioatdma-enabled hardware with net_dma enabled can leak the memory, crash the host
  leading to a denial-of-service or cause a random memory corruption.
