summary: In Libgcrypt before 1.7.7, an attacker who learns the EdDSA session key (from
  side-channel observation during the signing process) can easily recover the long-term
  secret key. 1.7.7 makes a cipher/ecc-eddsa.c change to store this session key in
  secure memory, to ensure that constant-time point operations are used in the MPI
  library.
