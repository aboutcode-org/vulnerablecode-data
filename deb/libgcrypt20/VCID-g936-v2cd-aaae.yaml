summary: Libgcrypt before 1.5.4, as used in GnuPG and other products, does not properly
  perform ciphertext normalization and ciphertext randomization, which makes it easier
  for physically proximate attackers to conduct key-extraction attacks by leveraging
  the ability to collect voltage data from exposed metal, a different vector than
  CVE-2013-4576.
