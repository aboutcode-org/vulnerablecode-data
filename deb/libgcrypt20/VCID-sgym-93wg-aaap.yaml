summary: Libgcrypt before 1.6.3 and GnuPG before 1.4.19 does not implement ciphertext
  blinding for Elgamal decryption, which allows physically proximate attackers to
  obtain the server's private key by determining factors using crafted ciphertext
  and the fluctuations in the electromagnetic field during multiplication.
