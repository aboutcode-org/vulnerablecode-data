summary: A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. A heap-based buffer overflow
  was discovered in dnsmasq when DNSSEC is enabled and before it validates the received
  DNS entries. This flaw allows a remote attacker, who can create valid DNS replies,
  to cause an overflow in a heap-allocated memory. This flaw is caused by the lack
  of length checks in rfc1035.c:extract_name(), which could be abused to make the
  code execute memcpy() with a negative size in sort_rrset() and cause a crash in
  dnsmasq, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability
  is to system availability.
