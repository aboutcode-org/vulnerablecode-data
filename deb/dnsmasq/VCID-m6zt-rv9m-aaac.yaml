severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in dnsmasq in versions before 2.85. When configured to use
  a specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed port while
  forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able to find the outgoing port used
  by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the random transmission ID to forge a reply and
  get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNS Cache Poisoning attack much easier.
  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.
