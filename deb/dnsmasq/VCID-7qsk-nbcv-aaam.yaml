summary: A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. A heap-based buffer overflow
  was discovered in the way RRSets are sorted before validating with DNSSEC data.
  An attacker on the network, who can forge DNS replies such as that they are accepted
  as valid, could use this flaw to cause a buffer overflow with arbitrary data in
  a heap memory segment, possibly executing code on the machine. The highest threat
  from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system
  availability.
