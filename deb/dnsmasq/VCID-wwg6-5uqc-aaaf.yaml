summary: A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply from
  a forwarded query, dnsmasq checks in the forward.c:reply_query() if the reply destination
  address/port is used by the pending forwarded queries. However, it does not use
  the address/port to retrieve the exact forwarded query, substantially reducing the
  number of attempts an attacker on the network would have to perform to forge a reply
  and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This issue contrasts with RFC5452, which specifies
  a query's attributes that all must be used to match a reply. This flaw allows an
  attacker to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning attack. If chained with CVE-2020-25685
  or CVE-2020-25686, the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced. The
  highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.
