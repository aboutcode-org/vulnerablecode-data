summary: A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply from
  a forwarded query, dnsmasq checks in forward.c:reply_query(), which is the forwarded
  query that matches the reply, by only using a weak hash of the query name. Due to
  the weak hash (CRC32 when dnsmasq is compiled without DNSSEC, SHA-1 when it is)
  this flaw allows an off-path attacker to find several different domains all having
  the same hash, substantially reducing the number of attempts they would have to
  perform to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This is in contrast with
  RFC5452, which specifies that the query name is one of the attributes of a query
  that must be used to match a reply. This flaw could be abused to perform a DNS Cache
  Poisoning attack. If chained with CVE-2020-25684 the attack complexity of a successful
  attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.
