summary: A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When receiving a query,
  dnsmasq does not check for an existing pending request for the same name and forwards
  a new request. By default, a maximum of 150 pending queries can be sent to upstream
  servers, so there can be at most 150 queries for the same name. This flaw allows
  an off-path attacker on the network to substantially reduce the number of attempts
  that it would have to perform to forge a reply and have it accepted by dnsmasq.
  This issue is mentioned in the "Birthday Attacks" section of RFC5452. If chained
  with CVE-2020-25684, the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced. The
  highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.
