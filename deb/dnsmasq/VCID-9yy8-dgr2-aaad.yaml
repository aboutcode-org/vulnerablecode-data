severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with
  Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where
  it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local
  subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq
  in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address
  on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of
  Service (DDoS) against other systems.
