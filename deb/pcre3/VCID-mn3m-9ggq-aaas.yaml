severities: []
summary: pcre_jit_compile.c in PCRE 8.35 does not properly use table jumps to optimize
  nested alternatives, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (stack memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
  string, as demonstrated by packets encountered by Suricata during use of a regular
  expression in an Emerging Threats Open ruleset.
