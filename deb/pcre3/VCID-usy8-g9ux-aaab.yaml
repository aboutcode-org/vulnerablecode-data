summary: The compile_branch function in PCRE before 8.37 allows context-dependent
  attackers to compile incorrect code, cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds heap
  read and crash), or possibly have other unspecified impact via a regular expression
  with a group containing a forward reference repeated a large number of times within
  a repeated outer group that has a zero minimum quantifier.
