summary: 'Integer overflow in Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before
  6.7 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a regular expression
  containing a large number of named subpatterns (name_count) or long subpattern names
  (max_name_size), which triggers a buffer overflow. NOTE: this issue was originally
  subsumed by CVE-2006-7224, but that CVE has been REJECTED and split.'
