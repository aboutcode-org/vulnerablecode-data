summary: PCRE before 8.36 mishandles the /(((a\2)|(a*)\g<-1>))*/ pattern and related
  patterns with certain internal recursive back references, which allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other
  impact via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp
  object encountered by Konqueror.
