summary: PCRE before 8.38 mishandles the /(?=di(?<=(?1))|(?=(.))))/ pattern and related
  patterns with an unmatched closing parenthesis, which allows remote attackers to
  cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact
  via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object
  encountered by Konqueror.
