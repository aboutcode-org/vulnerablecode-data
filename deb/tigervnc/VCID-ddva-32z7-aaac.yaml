severities: []
summary: TigerVNC version prior to 1.10.1 is vulnerable to stack buffer overflow,
  which could be triggered from CMsgReader::readSetCursor. This vulnerability occurs
  due to insufficient sanitization of PixelFormat. Since remote attacker can choose
  offset from start of the buffer to start writing his values, exploitation of this
  vulnerability could potentially result into remote code execution. This attack appear
  to be exploitable via network connectivity.
