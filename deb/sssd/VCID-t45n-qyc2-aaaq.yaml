severities: []
summary: The UNIX pipe which sudo uses to contact SSSD and read the available sudo
  rules from SSSD has too wide permissions, which means that anyone who can send a
  message using the same raw protocol that sudo and SSSD use can read the sudo rules
  available for any user. This affects versions of SSSD before 1.16.3.
