severities: []
summary: A vulnerability was found in sssd. If a user was configured with no home
  directory set, sssd would return '/' (the root directory) instead of '' (the empty
  string / no home directory). This could impact services that restrict the user's
  filesystem access to within their home directory through chroot() etc. All versions
  before 2.1 are vulnerable.
