summary: System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) before 1.0.1, when the krb5 auth_provider
  is configured but the KDC is unreachable, allows physically proximate attackers
  to authenticate, via an arbitrary password, to the screen-locking program on a workstation
  that has any user's Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT); and might allow remote
  attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via vectors involving an arbitrary
  password in conjunction with a valid TGT.
