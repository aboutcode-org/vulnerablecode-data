summary: wolfSSL and wolfCrypt 4.1.0 and earlier (formerly known as CyaSSL) generate
  biased DSA nonces. This allows a remote attacker to compute the long term private
  key from several hundred DSA signatures via a lattice attack. The issue occurs because
  dsa.c fixes two bits of the generated nonces.
