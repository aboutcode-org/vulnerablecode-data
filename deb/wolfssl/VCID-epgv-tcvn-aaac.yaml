summary: wolfSSL (formerly CyaSSL) before 3.6.8 does not properly handle faults associated
  with the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) process when allowing ephemeral key exchange
  without low memory optimizations on a server, which makes it easier for remote attackers
  to obtain private RSA keys by capturing TLS handshakes, aka a Lenstra attack.
