summary: wolfSSL and wolfCrypt 4.0.0 and earlier (when configured without --enable-fpecc,
  --enable-sp, or --enable-sp-math) contain a timing side channel in ECDSA signature
  generation. This allows a local attacker, able to precisely measure the duration
  of signature operations, to infer information about the nonces used and potentially
  mount a lattice attack to recover the private key used. The issue occurs because
  ecc.c scalar multiplication might leak the bit length.
