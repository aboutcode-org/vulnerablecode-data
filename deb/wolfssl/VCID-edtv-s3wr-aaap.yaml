summary: In wolfSSL 4.1.0 through 4.2.0c, there are missing sanity checks of memory
  accesses in parsing ASN.1 certificate data while handshaking. Specifically, there
  is a one-byte heap-based buffer overflow inside the DecodedCert structure in GetName
  in wolfcrypt/src/asn.c because the domain name location index is mishandled. Because
  a pointer is overwritten, there is an invalid free.
