summary: '** DISPUTED ** Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in nrpe.c in Nagios Remote
  Plugin Executor (NRPE) 2.15 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
  commands via a newline character in the -a option to libexec/check_nrpe.  NOTE:
  this issue is disputed by multiple parties. It has been reported that the vendor
  allows newlines as "expected behavior." Also, this issue can only occur when the
  administrator enables the "dont_blame_nrpe" option in nrpe.conf despite the "HIGH
  security risk" warning within the comments.'
