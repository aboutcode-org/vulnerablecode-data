summary: This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary
  code on affected installations of Synology DiskStation Manager. Authentication is
  not required to exploit this vulnerablity. The specific flaw exists within the processing
  of DSI structures in Netatalk. The issue results from the lack of proper validation
  of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer.
