severities: []
summary: Multiple buffer overflows in Andy Lo-A-Foe AlsaPlayer 0.99.76 and earlier
  allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash), or have
  other unknown impact, via (1) a long Location field sent by a web server, which
  triggers an overflow in the reconnect function in reader/http/http.c; (2) a long
  URL sent by a web server when AlsaPlayer is seeking a media file for the playlist,
  which triggers overflows in new_list_item and CbUpdated in interface/gtk/PlaylistWindow.cpp;
  and (3) a long response sent by a CDDB server, which triggers an overflow in cddb_lookup
  in input/ccda/cdda_engine.c.
