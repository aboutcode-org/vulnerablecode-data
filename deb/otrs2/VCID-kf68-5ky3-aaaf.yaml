severities: []
summary: Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.4.4 grants ticket access on the
  basis of single-digit substrings of the CustomerID value, which allows remote authenticated
  users to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by visiting
  a ticket, as demonstrated by leveraging the CustomerID 12 account to read tickets
  that should be available only to CustomerID 1 or CustomerID 2.
