severities: []
summary: The S/MIME feature in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.3.4 does
  not configure the RANDFILE and HOME environment variables for OpenSSL, which might
  make it easier for remote attackers to decrypt e-mail messages that had lower than
  intended entropy available for cryptographic operations, related to inability to
  write to the seeding file.
