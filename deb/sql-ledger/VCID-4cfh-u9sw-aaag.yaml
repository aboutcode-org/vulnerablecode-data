summary: 'Directory traversal vulnerability in am.pl in (1) SQL-Ledger 2.6.27 and
  earlier, and (2) LedgerSMB before 1.2.0, allows remote attackers to run arbitrary
  executables and bypass authentication via a .. (dot dot) sequence and trailing NULL
  (%00) in the login parameter.  NOTE: this issue was reportedly addressed in SQL-Ledger
  2.6.27, however third-party researchers claim that the file is still executed even
  though an error is generated.'
