severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in ntopng 3.4 before 3.4.180617. The PRNG involved
  in the generation of session IDs is not seeded at program startup. This results
  in deterministic session IDs being allocated for active user sessions. An attacker
  with foreknowledge of the operating system and standard library in use by the host
  running the service and the username of the user whose session they're targeting
  can abuse the deterministic random number generation in order to hijack the user's
  session, thus escalating their access.
