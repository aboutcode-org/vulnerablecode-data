summary: The IIS/ISAPI specific code in the Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector 1.2.0
  to 1.2.42 that normalised the requested path before matching it to the URI-worker
  map did not handle some edge cases correctly. If only a sub-set of the URLs supported
  by Tomcat were exposed via IIS, then it was possible for a specially constructed
  request to expose application functionality through the reverse proxy that was not
  intended for clients accessing Tomcat via the reverse proxy.
