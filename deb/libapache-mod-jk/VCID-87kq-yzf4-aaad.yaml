summary: The Apache Web Server (httpd) specific code that normalised the requested
  path before matching it to the URI-worker map in Apache Tomcat JK (mod_jk) Connector
  1.2.0 to 1.2.44 did not handle some edge cases correctly. If only a sub-set of the
  URLs supported by Tomcat were exposed via httpd, then it was possible for a specially
  constructed request to expose application functionality through the reverse proxy
  that was not intended for clients accessing the application via the reverse proxy.
  It was also possible in some configurations for a specially constructed request
  to bypass the access controls configured in httpd. While there is some overlap between
  this issue and CVE-2018-1323, they are not identical.
