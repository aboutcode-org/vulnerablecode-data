severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Icinga 2.x through 2.8.1. By editing the init.conf
  file, Icinga 2 can be run as root. Following this the program can be used to run
  arbitrary code as root. This was fixed by no longer using init.conf to determine
  account information for any root-executed code (a larger issue than CVE-2017-16933).
