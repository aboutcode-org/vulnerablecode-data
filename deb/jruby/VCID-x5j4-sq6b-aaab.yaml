severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x
  through 3.0.1. Net::IMAP does not raise an exception when StartTLS fails with an
  an unknown response, which might allow man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass the
  TLS protections by leveraging a network position between the client and the registry
  to block the StartTLS command, aka a "StartTLS stripping attack."
