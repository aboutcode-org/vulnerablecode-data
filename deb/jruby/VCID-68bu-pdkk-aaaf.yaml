severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x
  through 3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP
  into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl
  extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed
  (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).
