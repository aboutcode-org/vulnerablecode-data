summary: camel/providers/imapx/camel-imapx-server.c in the IMAPx component in GNOME
  evolution-data-server before 3.21.2 proceeds with cleartext data containing a password
  if the client wishes to use STARTTLS but the server will not use STARTTLS, which
  makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing
  the network. The server code was intended to report an error and not proceed, but
  the code was written incorrectly.
