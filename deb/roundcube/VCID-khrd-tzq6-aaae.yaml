severities: []
summary: 'In Roundcube from versions 1.2.0 to 1.3.5, with the archive plugin enabled
  and configured, it''s possible to exploit the unsanitized, user-controlled "_uid"
  parameter (in an archive.php _task=mail&_mbox=INBOX&_action=plugin.move2archive
  request) to perform an MX (IMAP) injection attack by placing an IMAP command after
  a %0d%0a sequence. NOTE: this is less easily exploitable in 1.3.4 and later because
  of a Same Origin Policy protection mechanism.'
