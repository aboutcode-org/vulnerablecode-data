severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing 32-bit PV guest OS
  users to gain guest OS privileges by installing and using descriptors. There is
  missing descriptor table limit checking in x86 PV emulation. When emulating certain
  PV guest operations, descriptor table accesses are performed by the emulating code.
  Such accesses should respect the guest specified limits, unless otherwise guaranteed
  to fail in such a case. Without this, emulation of 32-bit guest user mode calls
  through call gates would allow guest user mode to install and then use descriptors
  of their choice, as long as the guest kernel did not itself install an LDT. (Most
  OSes don't install any LDT by default). 32-bit PV guest user mode can elevate its
  privileges to that of the guest kernel. Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are
  affected. Only 32-bit PV guest user mode can leverage this vulnerability. HVM, PVH,
  as well as 64-bit PV guests cannot leverage this vulnerability. Arm systems are
  unaffected.
