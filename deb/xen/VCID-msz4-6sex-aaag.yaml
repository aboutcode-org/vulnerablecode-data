summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Recording of the per-vCPU
  control block mapping maintained by Xen and that of pointers into the control block
  is reversed. The consumer assumes, seeing the former initialized, that the latter
  are also ready for use. Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service
  (DoS) attack affecting the entire system.
