summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is a race condition
  when migrating timers between x86 HVM vCPUs. When migrating timers of x86 HVM guests
  between its vCPUs, the locking model used allows for a second vCPU of the same guest
  (also operating on the timers) to release a lock that it didn't acquire. The most
  likely effect of the issue is a hang or crash of the hypervisor, i.e., a Denial
  of Service (DoS). All versions of Xen are affected. Only x86 systems are vulnerable.
  Arm systems are not vulnerable. Only x86 HVM guests can leverage the vulnerability.
  x86 PV and PVH cannot leverage the vulnerability. Only guests with more than one
  vCPU can exploit the vulnerability.
