summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing attackers to gain
  host OS privileges via DMA in a situation where an untrusted domain has access to
  a physical device (and assignable-add is not used), because of an incomplete fix
  for CVE-2019-18424. XSA-302 relies on the use of libxl's "assignable-add" feature
  to prepare devices to be assigned to untrusted guests. Unfortunately, this is not
  considered a strictly required step for device assignment. The PCI passthrough documentation
  on the wiki describes alternate ways of preparing devices for assignment, and libvirt
  uses its own ways as well. Hosts where these "alternate" methods are used will still
  leave the system in a vulnerable state after the device comes back from a guest.
  An untrusted domain with access to a physical device can DMA into host memory, leading
  to privilege escalation. Only systems where guests are given direct access to physical
  devices capable of DMA (PCI pass-through) are vulnerable. Systems which do not use
  PCI pass-through are not vulnerable.
