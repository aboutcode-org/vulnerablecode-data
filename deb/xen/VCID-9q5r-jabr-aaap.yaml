summary: 'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 guest OS users
  to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) because certain bit iteration is mishandled.
  In a number of places bitmaps are being used by the hypervisor to track certain
  state. Iteration over all bits involves functions which may misbehave in certain
  corner cases: On x86 accesses to bitmaps with a compile time known size of 64 may
  incur undefined behavior, which may in particular result in infinite loops. A malicious
  guest may cause a hypervisor crash or hang, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).
  All versions of Xen are vulnerable. x86 systems with 64 or more nodes are vulnerable
  (there might not be any such systems that Xen would run on). x86 systems with less
  than 64 nodes are not vulnerable.'
