summary: 'The xrstor function in arch/x86/xstate.c in Xen 4.x does not properly handle
  writes to the hardware FSW.ES bit when running on AMD64 processors, which allows
  local guest OS users to obtain sensitive register content information from another
  guest by leveraging pending exception and mask bits.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists
  because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2013-2076.'
