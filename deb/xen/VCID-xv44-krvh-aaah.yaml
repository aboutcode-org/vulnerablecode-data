summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Nodes in xenstore have an
  ownership. In oxenstored, a owner could give a node away. However, node ownership
  has quota implications. Any guest can run another guest out of quota, or create
  an unbounded number of nodes owned by dom0, thus running xenstored out of memory
  A malicious guest administrator can cause a denial of service against a specific
  guest or against the whole host. All systems using oxenstored are vulnerable. Building
  and using oxenstored is the default in the upstream Xen distribution, if the Ocaml
  compiler is available. Systems using C xenstored are not vulnerable.
