summary: The do_hvm_op function in xen/arch/x86/hvm/hvm.c in Xen 4.2.x on the x86_32
  platform does not prevent HVM_PARAM_NESTEDHVM (aka nested virtualization) operations,
  which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (long-duration page mappings
  and host OS crash) by leveraging administrative access to an HVM guest in a domain
  with a large number of VCPUs.
