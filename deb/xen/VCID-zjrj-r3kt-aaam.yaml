summary: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to
  multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which
  CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should
  be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation
  phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they
  can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all
  systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such
  mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified
  by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695).
  Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the
  identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges
  of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).
