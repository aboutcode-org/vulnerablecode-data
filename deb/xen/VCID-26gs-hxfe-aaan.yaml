summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing Arm guest OS users
  to cause a hypervisor crash because of a missing alignment check in VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info.
  The hypercall VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info is used by a guest to register a shared
  region with the hypervisor. The region will be mapped into Xen address space so
  it can be directly accessed. On Arm, the region is accessed with instructions that
  require a specific alignment. Unfortunately, there is no check that the address
  provided by the guest will be correctly aligned. As a result, a malicious guest
  could cause a hypervisor crash by passing a misaligned address. A malicious guest
  administrator may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).
  All Xen versions are vulnerable. Only Arm systems are vulnerable. x86 systems are
  not affected.
