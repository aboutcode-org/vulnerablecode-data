summary: guests may exceed their designated memory limit When a guest is permitted
  to have close to 16TiB of memory, it may be able to issue hypercalls to increase
  its memory allocation beyond the administrator established limit. This is a result
  of a calculation done with 32-bit precision, which may overflow. It would then only
  be the overflowed (and hence small) number which gets compared against the established
  upper bound.
