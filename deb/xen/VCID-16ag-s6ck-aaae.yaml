summary: 'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users
  to cause a denial of service via degenerate chains of linear pagetables, because
  of an incorrect fix for CVE-2017-15595. "Linear pagetables" is a technique which
  involves either pointing a pagetable at itself, or to another pagetable of the same
  or higher level. Xen has limited support for linear pagetables: A page may either
  point to itself, or point to another pagetable of the same level (i.e., L2 to L2,
  L3 to L3, and so on). XSA-240 introduced an additional restriction that limited
  the "depth" of such chains by allowing pages to either *point to* other pages of
  the same level, or *be pointed to* by other pages of the same level, but not both.
  To implement this, we keep track of the number of outstanding times a page points
  to or is pointed to another page table, to prevent both from happening at the same
  time. Unfortunately, the original commit introducing this reset this count when
  resuming validation of a partially-validated pagetable, incorrectly dropping some
  "linear_pt_entry" counts. If an attacker could engineer such a situation to occur,
  they might be able to make loops or other arbitrary chains of linear pagetables,
  as described in XSA-240. A malicious or buggy PV guest may cause the hypervisor
  to crash, resulting in Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Privilege
  escalation and information leaks cannot be excluded. All versions of Xen are vulnerable.
  Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 PV guests
  can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot leverage the vulnerability.
  Only systems which have enabled linear pagetables are vulnerable. Systems which
  have disabled linear pagetables, either by selecting CONFIG_PV_LINEAR_PT=n when
  building the hypervisor, or adding pv-linear-pt=false on the command-line, are not
  vulnerable.'
