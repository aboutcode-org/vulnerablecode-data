summary: Xen 3.4 through 4.2, and possibly earlier versions, does not properly synchronize
  the p2m and m2p tables when the set_p2m_entry function fails, which allows local
  HVM guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and
  assertion failure), aka "Memory mapping failure DoS vulnerability."
