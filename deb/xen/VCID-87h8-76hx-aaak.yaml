summary: 'Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x, when running on AMD64 processors, only save/restore
  the FOP, FIP, and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an exception is pending,
  which allows one domain to determine portions of the state of floating point instructions
  of other domains, which can be leveraged to obtain sensitive information such as
  cryptographic keys, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2006-1056. NOTE: this is the
  documented behavior of AMD64 processors, but it is inconsistent with Intel processors
  in a security-relevant fashion that was not addressed by the kernels.'
