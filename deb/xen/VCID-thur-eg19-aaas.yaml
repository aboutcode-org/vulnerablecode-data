summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users to
  cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges because of missing memory
  barriers in read-write unlock paths. The read-write unlock paths don't contain a
  memory barrier. On Arm, this means a processor is allowed to re-order the memory
  access with the preceding ones. In other words, the unlock may be seen by another
  processor before all the memory accesses within the "critical" section. As a consequence,
  it may be possible to have a writer executing a critical section at the same time
  as readers or another writer. In other words, many of the assumptions (e.g., a variable
  cannot be modified after a check) in the critical sections are not safe anymore.
  The read-write locks are used in hypercalls (such as grant-table ones), so a malicious
  guest could exploit the race. For instance, there is a small window where Xen can
  leak memory if XENMAPSPACE_grant_table is used concurrently. A malicious guest may
  be able to leak memory, or cause a hypervisor crash resulting in a Denial of Service
  (DoS). Information leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded.
