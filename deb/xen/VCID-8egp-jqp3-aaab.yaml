summary: arch/x86/hvm/vmx/vmcs.c in the virtual-machine control structure (VMCS) implementation
  in the Linux kernel 2.6.18 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5, when an Intel platform
  without Extended Page Tables (EPT) functionality is used, accesses VMCS fields without
  verifying hardware support for these fields, which allows local users to cause a
  denial of service (host OS crash) by requesting a VMCS dump for a fully virtualized
  Xen guest.
