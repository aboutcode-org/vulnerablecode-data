summary: certain VT-d IOMMUs may not work in shared page table mode For efficiency
  reasons, address translation control structures (page tables) may (and, on suitable
  hardware, by default will) be shared between CPUs, for second-level translation
  (EPT), and IOMMUs. These page tables are presently set up to always be 4 levels
  deep. However, an IOMMU may require the use of just 3 page table levels. In such
  a configuration the lop level table needs to be stripped before inserting the root
  table's address into the hardware pagetable base register. When sharing page tables,
  Xen erroneously skipped this stripping. Consequently, the guest is able to write
  to leaf page table entries.
