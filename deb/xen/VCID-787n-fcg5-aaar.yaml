summary: In Xen 4.10, new infrastructure was introduced as part of an overhaul to
  how MSR emulation happens for guests. Unfortunately, one tracking structure isn't
  freed when a vcpu is destroyed. This allows guest OS administrators to cause a denial
  of service (host OS memory consumption) by rebooting many times.
