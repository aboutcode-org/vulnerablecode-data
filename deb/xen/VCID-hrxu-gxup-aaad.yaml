summary: Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access
  to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated
  / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages,
  however, are de-allocated when a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such
  pages requires that the hypervisor enforce that no parallel request can result in
  the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing,
  allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for
  other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar issue
  was not noticed.
