summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Access rights of Xenstore
  nodes are per domid. Unfortunately, existing granted access rights are not removed
  when a domain is being destroyed. This means that a new domain created with the
  same domid will inherit the access rights to Xenstore nodes from the previous domain(s)
  with the same domid. Because all Xenstore entries of a guest below /local/domain/<domid>
  are being deleted by Xen tools when a guest is destroyed, only Xenstore entries
  of other guests still running are affected. For example, a newly created guest domain
  might be able to read sensitive information that had belonged to a previously existing
  guest domain. Both Xenstore implementations (C and Ocaml) are vulnerable.
