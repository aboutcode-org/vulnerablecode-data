summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. The PCI passthrough code improperly
  uses register data. Code paths in Xen's MSI handling have been identified that act
  on unsanitized values read back from device hardware registers. While devices strictly
  compliant with PCI specifications shouldn't be able to affect these registers, experience
  shows that it's very common for devices to have out-of-spec "backdoor" operations
  that can affect the result of these reads. A not fully trusted guest may be able
  to crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. Privilege
  escalation and information leaks cannot be excluded. All versions of Xen supporting
  PCI passthrough are affected. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. Arm systems are not
  vulnerable. Only guests with passed through PCI devices may be able to leverage
  the vulnerability. Only systems passing through devices with out-of-spec ("backdoor")
  functionality can cause issues. Experience shows that such out-of-spec functionality
  is common; unless you have reason to believe that your device does not have such
  functionality, it's better to assume that it does.
