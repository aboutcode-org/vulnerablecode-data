summary: 'Xen through 4.14.x allows guest OS administrators to obtain sensitive information
  (such as AES keys from outside the guest) via a side-channel attack on a power/energy
  monitoring interface, aka a "Platypus" attack. NOTE: there is only one logically
  independent fix: to change the access control for each such interface in Xen.'
