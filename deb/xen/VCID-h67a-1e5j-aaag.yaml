severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen 4.12.3 through 4.12.4 and 4.13.1 through 4.14.x.
  An x86 HVM guest with PCI pass through devices can force the allocation of all IDT
  vectors on the system by rebooting itself with MSI or MSI-X capabilities enabled
  and entries setup. Such reboots will leak any vectors used by the MSI(-X) entries
  that the guest might had enabled, and hence will lead to vector exhaustion on the
  system, not allowing further PCI pass through devices to work properly. HVM guests
  with PCI pass through devices can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting
  the pass through of PCI devices to other guests or the hardware domain. In the latter
  case, this would affect the entire host.
