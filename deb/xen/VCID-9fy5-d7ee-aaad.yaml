summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. When they require assistance
  from the device model, x86 HVM guests must be temporarily de-scheduled. The device
  model will signal Xen when it has completed its operation, via an event channel,
  so that the relevant vCPU is rescheduled. If the device model were to signal Xen
  without having actually completed the operation, the de-schedule / re-schedule cycle
  would repeat. If, in addition, Xen is resignalled very quickly, the re-schedule
  may occur before the de-schedule was fully complete, triggering a shortcut. This
  potentially repeating process uses ordinary recursive function calls, and thus could
  result in a stack overflow. A malicious or buggy stubdomain serving a HVM guest
  can cause Xen to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) to the entire host.
  Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 stubdomains
  serving HVM guests can exploit the vulnerability.
