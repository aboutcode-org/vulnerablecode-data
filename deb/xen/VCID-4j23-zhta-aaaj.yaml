summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x. Grant copying code made an
  implication that any grant pin would be accompanied by a suitable page reference.
  Other portions of code, however, did not match up with that assumption. When such
  a grant copy operation is being done on a grant of a dying domain, the assumption
  turns out wrong. A malicious guest administrator can cause hypervisor memory corruption,
  most likely resulting in host crash and a Denial of Service. Privilege escalation
  and information leaks cannot be ruled out.
