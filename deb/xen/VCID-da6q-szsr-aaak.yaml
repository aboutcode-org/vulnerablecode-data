summary: A grant unmapping issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x. When removing
  or replacing a grant mapping, the x86 PV specific path needs to make sure page table
  entries remain in sync with other accounting done. Although the identity of the
  page frame was validated correctly, neither the presence of the mapping nor page
  writability were taken into account.
