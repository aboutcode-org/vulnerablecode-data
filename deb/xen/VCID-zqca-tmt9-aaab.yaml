summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. ARM never properly implemented
  grant table v2, either in the hypervisor or in Linux. Unfortunately, an ARM guest
  can still request v2 grant tables; they will simply not be properly set up, resulting
  in subsequent grant-related hypercalls hitting BUG() checks. An unprivileged guest
  can cause a BUG() check in the hypervisor, resulting in a denial-of-service (crash).
