summary: An issue was discovered in Xen 4.14.x. There is a missing unlock in the XENMEM_acquire_resource
  error path. The RCU (Read, Copy, Update) mechanism is a synchronisation primitive.
  A buggy error path in the XENMEM_acquire_resource exits without releasing an RCU
  reference, which is conceptually similar to forgetting to unlock a spinlock. A buggy
  or malicious HVM stubdomain can cause an RCU reference to be leaked. This causes
  subsequent administration operations, (e.g., CPU offline) to livelock, resulting
  in a host Denial of Service. The buggy codepath has been present since Xen 4.12.
  Xen 4.14 and later are vulnerable to the DoS. The side effects are believed to be
  benign on Xen 4.12 and 4.13, but patches are provided nevertheless. The vulnerability
  can generally only be exploited by x86 HVM VMs, as these are generally the only
  type of VM that have a Qemu stubdomain. x86 PV and PVH domains, as well as ARM VMs,
  typically don't use a stubdomain. Only VMs using HVM stubdomains can exploit the
  vulnerability. VMs using PV stubdomains, or with emulators running in dom0, cannot
  exploit the vulnerability.
