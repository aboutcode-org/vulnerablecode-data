summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. In the Ocaml xenstored implementation,
  the internal representation of the tree has special cases for the root node, because
  this node has no parent. Unfortunately, permissions were not checked for certain
  operations on the root node. Unprivileged guests can get and modify permissions,
  list, and delete the root node. (Deleting the whole xenstore tree is a host-wide
  denial of service.) Achieving xenstore write access is also possible. All systems
  using oxenstored are vulnerable. Building and using oxenstored is the default in
  the upstream Xen distribution, if the Ocaml compiler is available. Systems using
  C xenstored are not vulnerable.
