summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is a lack of preemption
  in evtchn_reset() / evtchn_destroy(). In particular, the FIFO event channel model
  allows guests to have a large number of event channels active at a time. Closing
  all of these (when resetting all event channels or when cleaning up after the guest)
  may take extended periods of time. So far, there was no arrangement for preemption
  at suitable intervals, allowing a CPU to spend an almost unbounded amount of time
  in the processing of these operations. Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mount
  a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the entire system. All Xen versions are
  vulnerable in principle. Whether versions 4.3 and older are vulnerable depends on
  underlying hardware characteristics.
