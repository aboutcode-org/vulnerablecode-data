summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users to
  cause a denial of service because of a bad error path in GNTTABOP_map_grant. Grant
  table operations are expected to return 0 for success, and a negative number for
  errors. Some misplaced brackets cause one error path to return 1 instead of a negative
  value. The grant table code in Linux treats this condition as success, and proceeds
  with incorrectly initialised state. A buggy or malicious guest can construct its
  grant table in such a way that, when a backend domain tries to map a grant, it hits
  the incorrect error path. This will crash a Linux based dom0 or backend domain.
