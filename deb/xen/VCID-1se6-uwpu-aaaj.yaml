summary: 'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. x86 PV guest kernels can
  experience denial of service via SYSENTER. The SYSENTER instruction leaves various
  state sanitization activities to software. One of Xen''s sanitization paths injects
  a #GP fault, and incorrectly delivers it twice to the guest. This causes the guest
  kernel to observe a kernel-privilege #GP fault (typically fatal) rather than a user-privilege
  #GP fault (usually converted into SIGSEGV/etc.). Malicious or buggy userspace can
  crash the guest kernel, resulting in a VM Denial of Service. All versions of Xen
  from 3.2 onwards are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM platforms
  are not vulnerable. Only x86 systems that support the SYSENTER instruction in 64bit
  mode are vulnerable. This is believed to be Intel, Centaur, and Shanghai CPUs. AMD
  and Hygon CPUs are not believed to be vulnerable. Only x86 PV guests can exploit
  the vulnerability. x86 PVH / HVM guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.'
