summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x. Certain PV MMU operations
  may take a long time to process. For that reason Xen explicitly checks for the need
  to preempt the current vCPU at certain points. A few rarely taken code paths did
  bypass such checks. By suitably enforcing the conditions through its own page table
  contents, a malicious guest may cause such bypasses to be used for an unbounded
  number of iterations. A malicious or buggy PV guest may cause a Denial of Service
  (DoS) affecting the entire host. Specifically, it may prevent use of a physical
  CPU for an indeterminate period of time. All Xen versions from 3.4 onwards are vulnerable.
  Xen versions 3.3 and earlier are vulnerable to an even wider class of attacks, due
  to them lacking preemption checks altogether in the affected code paths. Only x86
  systems are affected. ARM systems are not affected. Only multi-vCPU x86 PV guests
  can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM or PVH guests as well as x86 single-vCPU
  PV ones cannot leverage the vulnerability.
