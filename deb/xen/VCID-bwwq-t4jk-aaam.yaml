severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing ARM guest OS users
  to cause a denial of service or gain privileges by leveraging the erroneous enabling
  of interrupts. Interrupts are unconditionally unmasked in exception handlers. When
  an exception occurs on an ARM system which is handled without changing processor
  level, some interrupts are unconditionally enabled during exception entry. So exceptions
  which occur when interrupts are masked will effectively unmask the interrupts. A
  malicious guest might contrive to arrange for critical Xen code to run with interrupts
  erroneously enabled. This could lead to data corruption, denial of service, or possibly
  even privilege escalation. However a precise attack technique has not been identified.
