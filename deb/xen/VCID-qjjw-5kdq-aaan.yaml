summary: The grant-table feature in Xen through 4.8.x mishandles a GNTMAP_device_map
  and GNTMAP_host_map mapping, when followed by only a GNTMAP_host_map unmapping,
  which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (count mismanagement and
  memory corruption) or obtain privileged host OS access, aka XSA-224 bug 1.
