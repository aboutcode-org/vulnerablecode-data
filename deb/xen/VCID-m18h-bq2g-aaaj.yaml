summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Xenstored and guests communicate
  via a shared memory page using a specific protocol. When a guest violates this protocol,
  xenstored will drop the connection to that guest. Unfortunately, this is done by
  just removing the guest from xenstored's internal management, resulting in the same
  actions as if the guest had been destroyed, including sending an @releaseDomain
  event. @releaseDomain events do not say that the guest has been removed. All watchers
  of this event must look at the states of all guests to find the guest that has been
  removed. When an @releaseDomain is generated due to a domain xenstored protocol
  violation, because the guest is still running, the watchers will not react. Later,
  when the guest is actually destroyed, xenstored will no longer have it stored in
  its internal data base, so no further @releaseDomain event will be sent. This can
  lead to a zombie domain; memory mappings of that guest's memory will not be removed,
  due to the missing event. This zombie domain will be cleaned up only after another
  domain is destroyed, as that will trigger another @releaseDomain event. If the device
  model of the guest that violated the Xenstore protocol is running in a stub-domain,
  a use-after-free case could happen in xenstored, after having removed the guest
  from its internal data base, possibly resulting in a crash of xenstored. A malicious
  guest can block resources of the host for a period after its own death. Guests with
  a stub domain device model can eventually crash xenstored, resulting in a more serious
  denial of service (the prevention of any further domain management operations).
  Only the C variant of Xenstore is affected; the Ocaml variant is not affected. Only
  HVM guests with a stubdom device model can cause a serious DoS.
