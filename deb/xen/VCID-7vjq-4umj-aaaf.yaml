summary: issues with partially successful P2M updates on x86 T[his CNA information
  record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities
  correspond to which CVE.] x86 HVM and PVH guests may be started in populate-on-demand
  (PoD) mode, to provide a way for them to later easily have more memory assigned.
  Guests are permitted to control certain P2M aspects of individual pages via hypercalls.
  These hypercalls may act on ranges of pages specified via page orders (resulting
  in a power-of-2 number of pages). In some cases the hypervisor carries out the requests
  by splitting them into smaller chunks. Error handling in certain PoD cases has been
  insufficient in that in particular partial success of some operations was not properly
  accounted for. There are two code paths affected - page removal (CVE-2021-28705)
  and insertion of new pages (CVE-2021-28709). (We provide one patch which combines
  the fix to both issues.)
