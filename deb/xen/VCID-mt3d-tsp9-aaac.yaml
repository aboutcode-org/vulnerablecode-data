severities: []
summary: Xen, when running on a 64-bit hypervisor, allows local x86 guest OS users
  to modify arbitrary memory and consequently obtain sensitive information, cause
  a denial of service (host crash), or execute arbitrary code on the host by leveraging
  broken emulation of bit test instructions.
