summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. A guest may access xenstore
  paths via absolute paths containing a full pathname, or via a relative path, which
  implicitly includes /local/domain/$DOMID for their own domain id. Management tools
  must access paths in guests' namespaces, necessarily using absolute paths. oxenstored
  imposes a pathname limit that is applied solely to the relative or absolute path
  specified by the client. Therefore, a guest can create paths in its own namespace
  which are too long for management tools to access. Depending on the toolstack in
  use, a malicious guest administrator might cause some management tools and debugging
  operations to fail. For example, a guest administrator can cause "xenstore-ls -r"
  to fail. However, a guest administrator cannot prevent the host administrator from
  tearing down the domain. All systems using oxenstored are vulnerable. Building and
  using oxenstored is the default in the upstream Xen distribution, if the Ocaml compiler
  is available. Systems using C xenstored are not vulnerable.
