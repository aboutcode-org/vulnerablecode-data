severities: []
summary: Xen 4.6.x and earlier does not properly enforce limits on page order inputs
  for the (1) XENMEM_increase_reservation, (2) XENMEM_populate_physmap, (3) XENMEM_exchange,
  and possibly other HYPERVISOR_memory_op suboperations, which allows ARM guest OS
  administrators to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption, guest reboot, or watchdog
  timeout and host reboot) and possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown
  vectors.
