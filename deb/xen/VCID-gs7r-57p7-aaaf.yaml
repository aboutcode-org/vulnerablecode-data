summary: Xen 4.0 through 4.3.x, when using AVX or LWP capable CPUs, does not properly
  clear previous data from registers when using an XSAVE or XRSTOR to extend the state
  components of a saved or restored vCPU after touching other restored extended registers,
  which allows local guest OSes to obtain sensitive information by reading the registers.
