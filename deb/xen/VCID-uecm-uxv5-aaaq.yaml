summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Out of bounds event channels
  are available to 32-bit x86 domains. The so called 2-level event channel model imposes
  different limits on the number of usable event channels for 32-bit x86 domains vs
  64-bit or Arm (either bitness) ones. 32-bit x86 domains can use only 1023 channels,
  due to limited space in their shared (between guest and Xen) information structure,
  whereas all other domains can use up to 4095 in this model. The recording of the
  respective limit during domain initialization, however, has occurred at a time where
  domains are still deemed to be 64-bit ones, prior to actually honoring respective
  domain properties. At the point domains get recognized as 32-bit ones, the limit
  didn't get updated accordingly. Due to this misbehavior in Xen, 32-bit domains (including
  Domain 0) servicing other domains may observe event channel allocations to succeed
  when they should really fail. Subsequent use of such event channels would then possibly
  lead to corruption of other parts of the shared info structure. An unprivileged
  guest may cause another domain, in particular Domain 0, to misbehave. This may lead
  to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards
  are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only x86 32-bit
  domains servicing other domains are vulnerable. Arm systems, as well as x86 64-bit
  domains, are not vulnerable.
