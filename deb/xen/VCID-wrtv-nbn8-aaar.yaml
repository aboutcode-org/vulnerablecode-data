summary: Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and earlier, when the hypervisor is running "under memory
  pressure" and the Xen Security Module (XSM) is enabled, uses the wrong ordering
  of operations when extending the per-domain event channel tracking table, which
  causes a use-after-free and allows local guest kernels to inject arbitrary events
  and gain privileges via unspecified vectors.
