summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. The logic in oxenstored for
  handling writes depended on the order of evaluation of expressions making up a tuple.
  As indicated in section 7.7.3 "Operations on data structures" of the OCaml manual,
  the order of evaluation of subexpressions is not specified. In practice, different
  implementations behave differently. Thus, oxenstored may not enforce the configured
  quota-maxentity. This allows a malicious or buggy guest to write as many xenstore
  entries as it wishes, causing unbounded memory usage in oxenstored. This can lead
  to a system-wide DoS.
