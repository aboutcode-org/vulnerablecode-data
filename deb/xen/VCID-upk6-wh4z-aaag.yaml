summary: inadequate grant-v2 status frames array bounds check The v2 grant table interface
  separates grant attributes from grant status. That is, when operating in this mode,
  a guest has two tables. As a result, guests also need to be able to retrieve the
  addresses that the new status tracking table can be accessed through. For 32-bit
  guests on x86, translation of requests has to occur because the interface structure
  layouts commonly differ between 32- and 64-bit. The translation of the request to
  obtain the frame numbers of the grant status table involves translating the resulting
  array of frame numbers. Since the space used to carry out the translation is limited,
  the translation layer tells the core function the capacity of the array within translation
  space. Unfortunately the core function then only enforces array bounds to be below
  8 times the specified value, and would write past the available space if enough
  frame numbers needed storing.
