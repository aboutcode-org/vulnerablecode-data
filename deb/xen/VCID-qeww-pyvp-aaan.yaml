summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. A bounds check common to most
  operation time functions specific to FIFO event channels depends on the CPU observing
  consistent state. While the producer side uses appropriately ordered writes, the
  consumer side isn't protected against re-ordered reads, and may hence end up de-referencing
  a NULL pointer. Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS)
  attack affecting the entire system. Only Arm systems may be vulnerable. Whether
  a system is vulnerable depends on the specific CPU. x86 systems are not vulnerable.
