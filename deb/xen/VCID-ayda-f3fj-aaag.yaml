summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. The DEBUGCTL MSR contains
  several debugging features, some of which virtualise cleanly, but some do not. In
  particular, Branch Trace Store is not virtualised by the processor, and software
  has to be careful to configure it suitably not to lock up the core. As a result,
  it must only be available to fully trusted guests. Unfortunately, in the case that
  vPMU is disabled, all value checking was skipped, allowing the guest to choose any
  MSR_DEBUGCTL setting it likes. A malicious or buggy guest administrator (on Intel
  x86 HVM or PVH) can lock up the entire host, causing a Denial of Service.
