summary: An issue was discovered in Xen 4.9 through 4.14.x. On Arm, a guest is allowed
  to control whether memory accesses are bypassing the cache. This means that Xen
  needs to ensure that all writes (such as the ones during scrubbing) have reached
  the memory before handing over the page to a guest. Unfortunately, the operation
  to clean the cache is happening before checking if the page was scrubbed. Therefore
  there is no guarantee when all the writes will reach the memory.
