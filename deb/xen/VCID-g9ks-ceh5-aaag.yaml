summary: Xen maintains the _GTF_{read,writ}ing bits as appropriate, to inform the
  guest that a grant is in use. A guest is expected not to modify the grant details
  while it is in use, whereas the guest is free to modify/reuse the grant entry when
  it is not in use. Under some circumstances, Xen will clear the status bits too early,
  incorrectly informing the guest that the grant is no longer in use. A guest may
  prematurely believe that a granted frame is safely private again, and reuse it in
  a way which contains sensitive information, while the domain on the far end of the
  grant is still using the grant. Xen 4.9, 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, and 4.5 are affected.
