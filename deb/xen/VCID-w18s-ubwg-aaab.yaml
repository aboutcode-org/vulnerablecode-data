severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users
  to gain host OS privileges by leveraging race conditions in pagetable promotion
  and demotion operations, because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-18421. XSA-299
  addressed several critical issues in restartable PV type change operations. Despite
  extensive testing and auditing, some corner cases were missed. A malicious PV guest
  administrator may be able to escalate their privilege to that of the host. All security-supported
  versions of Xen are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not
  affected. Only x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM and PVH guests
  cannot leverage the vulnerability. Note that these attacks require very precise
  timing, which may be difficult to exploit in practice.
