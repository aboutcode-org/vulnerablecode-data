summary: An issue was discovered in Xen 4.14.x. When moving IRQs between CPUs to distribute
  the load of IRQ handling, IRQ vectors are dynamically allocated and de-allocated
  on the relevant CPUs. De-allocation has to happen when certain constraints are met.
  If these conditions are not met when first checked, the checking CPU may send an
  interrupt to itself, in the expectation that this IRQ will be delivered only after
  the condition preventing the cleanup has cleared. For two specific IRQ vectors,
  this expectation was violated, resulting in a continuous stream of self-interrupts,
  which renders the CPU effectively unusable. A domain with a passed through PCI device
  can cause lockup of a physical CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) to the
  entire host. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. Arm systems are not vulnerable. Only
  guests with physical PCI devices passed through to them can exploit the vulnerability.
