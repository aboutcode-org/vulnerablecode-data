summary: Xen 4.2.x and 4.3.x, when using Intel VT-d and a PCI device has been assigned,
  does not clear the flag that suppresses IOMMU TLB flushes when unspecified errors
  occur, which causes the TLB entries to not be flushed and allows local guest administrators
  to cause a denial of service (host crash) or gain privileges via unspecified vectors.
