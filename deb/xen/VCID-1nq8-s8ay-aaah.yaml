summary: PCI devices with RMRRs not deassigned correctly Certain PCI devices in a
  system might be assigned Reserved Memory Regions (specified via Reserved Memory
  Region Reporting, "RMRR"). These are typically used for platform tasks such as legacy
  USB emulation. If such a device is passed through to a guest, then on guest shutdown
  the device is not properly deassigned. The IOMMU configuration for these devices
  which are not properly deassigned ends up pointing to a freed data structure, including
  the IO Pagetables. Subsequent DMA or interrupts from the device will have unpredictable
  behaviour, ranging from IOMMU faults to memory corruption.
