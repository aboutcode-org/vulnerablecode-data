summary: 'Xen 3.1 through 4.x, when running 64-bit hosts on Intel CPUs, does not clear
  the NT flag when using an IRET after a SYSENTER instruction, which allows PV guest
  users to cause a denial of service (hypervisor crash) by triggering a #GP fault,
  which is not properly handled by another IRET instruction.'
