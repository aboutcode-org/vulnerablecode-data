summary: The read_request_line function in server/protocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server
  2.4.12 does not initialize the protocol structure member, which allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and process crash) by sending
  a request that lacks a method to an installation that enables the INCLUDES filter
  and has an ErrorDocument 400 directive specifying a local URI.
