severities: []
summary: In Apache httpd before 2.2.34 and 2.4.x before 2.4.27, the value placeholder
  in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before
  or between successive key=value assignments by mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial
  key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory
  used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information,
  and a segfault in other cases resulting in denial of service.
