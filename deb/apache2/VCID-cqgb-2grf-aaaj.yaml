summary: In Apache httpd 2.0.23 to 2.0.65, 2.2.0 to 2.2.34, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, mod_authnz_ldap,
  if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value
  to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the
  header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism
  is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example,
  'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces
  an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the
  string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be
  used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already
  reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.
