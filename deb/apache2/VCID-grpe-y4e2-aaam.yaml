summary: A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server
  2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside
  the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories
  are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these
  requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes,
  this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited
  in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The
  fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.
