summary: 'The mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.x through 1.3.42, 2.0.x
  through 2.0.64, and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the Revision 1179239 patch is in
  place, does not properly interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2) ProxyPassMatch
  pattern matches for configuration of a reverse proxy, which allows remote attackers
  to send requests to intranet servers via a malformed URI containing an @ (at sign)
  character and a : (colon) character in invalid positions.  NOTE: this vulnerability
  exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-3368.'
