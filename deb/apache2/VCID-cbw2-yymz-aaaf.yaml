summary: In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, with MPM event, worker
  or prefork, code executing in less-privileged child processes or threads (including
  scripts executed by an in-process scripting interpreter) could execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the parent process (usually root) by manipulating the
  scoreboard. Non-Unix systems are not affected.
