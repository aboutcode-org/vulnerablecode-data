summary: The ap_some_auth_required function in server/request.c in the Apache HTTP
  Server 2.4.x before 2.4.14 does not consider that a Require directive may be associated
  with an authorization setting rather than an authentication setting, which allows
  remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances
  by leveraging the presence of a module that relies on the 2.2 API behavior.
