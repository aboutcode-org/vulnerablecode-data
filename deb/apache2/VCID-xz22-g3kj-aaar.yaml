summary: The mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.x through 1.3.42, 2.0.x
  through 2.0.64, and 2.2.x through 2.2.21 does not properly interact with use of
  (1) RewriteRule and (2) ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for configuration of a reverse
  proxy, which allows remote attackers to send requests to intranet servers via a
  malformed URI containing an initial @ (at sign) character.
