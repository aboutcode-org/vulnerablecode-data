severities: []
summary: 'mod_proxy in httpd in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.9, when running on Unix, does
  not close the backend connection if a timeout occurs when reading a response from
  a persistent connection, which allows remote attackers to obtain a potentially sensitive
  response intended for a different client in opportunistic circumstances via a normal
  HTTP request. NOTE: this is the same issue as CVE-2010-2068, but for a different
  OS and set of affected versions.'
