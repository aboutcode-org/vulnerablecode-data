summary: The chunked transfer coding implementation in the Apache HTTP Server before
  2.4.14 does not properly parse chunk headers, which allows remote attackers to conduct
  HTTP request smuggling attacks via a crafted request, related to mishandling of
  large chunk-size values and invalid chunk-extension characters in modules/http/http_filters.c.
