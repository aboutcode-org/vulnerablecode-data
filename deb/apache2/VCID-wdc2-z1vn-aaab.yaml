summary: A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior
  to version 2.4.30, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by
  reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible
  to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified as
  low risk for common server usage.
