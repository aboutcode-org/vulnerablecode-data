summary: The Apache HTTP Server 2.4.18 through 2.4.20, when mod_http2 and mod_ssl
  are enabled, does not properly recognize the "SSLVerifyClient require" directive
  for HTTP/2 request authorization, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
  access restrictions by leveraging the ability to send multiple requests over a single
  connection and aborting a renegotiation.
