summary: When an HTTP/2 stream was destroyed after being handled, the Apache HTTP
  Server prior to version 2.4.30 could have written a NULL pointer potentially to
  an already freed memory. The memory pools maintained by the server make this vulnerability
  hard to trigger in usual configurations, the reporter and the team could not reproduce
  it outside debug builds, so it is classified as low risk.
