summary: Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to unconstrained interal data
  buffering, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens the HTTP/2
  window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they leave the TCP window
  closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker
  then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the
  servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.
