summary: 'The Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.23 follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and
  therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data
  in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect
  an application''s outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted
  Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy" issue.  NOTE: the vendor states
  "This mitigation has been assigned the identifier CVE-2016-5387"; in other words,
  this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability.'
