summary: It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50
  was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files
  outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of
  these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require
  all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these
  aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue only affects
  Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.
