summary: 'The mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64 and
  2.2.x before 2.2.18, when the Revision 1179239 patch is in place, does not properly
  interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2) ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for
  configuration of a reverse proxy, which allows remote attackers to send requests
  to intranet servers by using the HTTP/0.9 protocol with a malformed URI containing
  an initial @ (at sign) character. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
  incomplete fix for CVE-2011-3368.'
