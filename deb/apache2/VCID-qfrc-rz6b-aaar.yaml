summary: In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.23, mod_session_crypto was encrypting
  its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes
  of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated
  encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with
  CBC.
