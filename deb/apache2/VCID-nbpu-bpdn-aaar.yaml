severities: []
summary: 'Multiple race conditions in suexec in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.2.3 between
  directory and file validation, and their usage, allow local users to gain privileges
  and execute arbitrary code by renaming directories or performing symlink attacks.
  NOTE: the researcher, who is reliable, claims that the vendor disputes the issue
  because "the attacks described rely on an insecure server configuration" in which
  the user "has write access to the document root."'
