summary: mod_lua.c in the mod_lua module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.3.x and 2.4.x
  through 2.4.10 does not support an httpd configuration in which the same Lua authorization
  provider is used with different arguments within different contexts, which allows
  remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances
  by leveraging multiple Require directives, as demonstrated by a configuration that
  specifies authorization for one group to access a certain directory, and authorization
  for a second group to access a second directory.
