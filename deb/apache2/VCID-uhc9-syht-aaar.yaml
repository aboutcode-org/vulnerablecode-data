severities: []
summary: A bug exists in the way mod_ssl handled client renegotiations. A remote attacker
  could send a carefully crafted request that would cause mod_ssl to enter a loop
  leading to a denial of service. This bug can be only triggered with Apache HTTP
  Server version 2.4.37 when using OpenSSL version 1.1.1 or later, due to an interaction
  in changes to handling of renegotiation attempts.
