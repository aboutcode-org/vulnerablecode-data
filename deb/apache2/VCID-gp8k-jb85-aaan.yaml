severities: []
summary: Apache httpd allows remote attackers to read secret data from process memory
  if the Limit directive can be set in a user's .htaccess file, or if httpd.conf has
  certain misconfigurations, aka Optionsbleed. This affects the Apache HTTP Server
  through 2.2.34 and 2.4.x through 2.4.27. The attacker sends an unauthenticated OPTIONS
  HTTP request when attempting to read secret data. This is a use-after-free issue
  and thus secret data is not always sent, and the specific data depends on many factors
  including configuration. Exploitation with .htaccess can be blocked with a patch
  to the ap_limit_section function in server/core.c.
