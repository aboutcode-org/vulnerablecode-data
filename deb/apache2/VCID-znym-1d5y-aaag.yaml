summary: In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, when mod_session is configured to forward
  its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote
  user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the
  "HTTP_SESSION" variable name used by mod_session to forward its data to CGIs, since
  the prefix "HTTP_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields,
  per CGI specifications.
