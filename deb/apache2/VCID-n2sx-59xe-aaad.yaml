summary: In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0-2.4.39, a limited cross-site scripting issue
  was reported affecting the mod_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link
  on the error page to be malformed and instead point to a page of their choice. This
  would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was
  misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed.
