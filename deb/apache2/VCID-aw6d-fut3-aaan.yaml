severities: []
summary: Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43. A specially crafted value for
  the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server
  actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature
  via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.
