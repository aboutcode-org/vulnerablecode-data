summary: Apache HTTP Server, in all releases prior to 2.2.32 and 2.4.25, was liberal
  in the whitespace accepted from requests and sent in response lines and headers.
  Accepting these different behaviors represented a security concern when httpd participates
  in any chain of proxies or interacts with back-end application servers, either through
  mod_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms, and may result in request smuggling,
  response splitting and cache pollution.
