severities: []
summary: An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists when loading a PCX file
  in SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted file can cause an integer overflow, resulting
  in too little memory being allocated, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potential
  code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted image file to trigger
  this vulnerability.
