summary: An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XPM image rendering
  function of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XPM image can cause an integer
  overflow in the colorhash function, allocating too small of a buffer. This buffer
  can then be written out of bounds, resulting in a heap overflow, ultimately ending
  in code execution. An attacker can display a specially crafted image to trigger
  this vulnerability.
