summary: The RPM GPG key import and handling feature in libzypp 12.15.0 and earlier
  reports a different key fingerprint than the one used to sign a repository when
  multiple key blobs are used, which might allow remote attackers to trick users into
  believing that the repository was signed by a more-trustworthy key.
