summary: '** DISPUTED ** chmextract.c in the chmextract sample program, as distributed
  with libmspack before 0.8alpha, does not protect against absolute/relative pathnames
  in CHM files, leading to Directory Traversal. NOTE: the vendor disputes that this
  is a libmspack vulnerability, because chmextract.c was only intended as a source-code
  example, not a supported application.'
