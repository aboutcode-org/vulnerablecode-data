summary: A flaw was found in, ghostscript versions prior to 9.50, in the .pdf_hook_DSC_Creator
  procedure where it did not properly secure its privileged calls, enabling scripts
  to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions. A specially crafted PostScript file could disable
  security protection and then have access to the file system, or execute arbitrary
  commands.
