summary: '** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 9.24.
  The .setdistillerkeys PostScript command is accepted even though it is not intended
  for use during document processing (e.g., after the startup phase). This leads to
  memory corruption, allowing remote attackers able to supply crafted PostScript to
  crash the interpreter or possibly have unspecified other impact. Note: A reputable
  source believes that the CVE is potentially a duplicate of CVE-2018-15910 as explained
  in Red Hat bugzilla (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1626193).'
