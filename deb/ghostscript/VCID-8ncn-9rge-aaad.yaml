summary: An issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 9.25. Incorrect "restoration
  of privilege" checking when running out of stack during exception handling could
  be used by attackers able to supply crafted PostScript to execute code using the
  "pipe" instruction. This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-16509.
