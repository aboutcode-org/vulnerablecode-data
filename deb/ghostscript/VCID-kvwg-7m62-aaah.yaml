summary: In Artifex Ghostscript through 9.25, the setpattern operator did not properly
  validate certain types. A specially crafted PostScript document could exploit this
  to crash Ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the context of the
  Ghostscript process. This is a type confusion issue because of failure to check
  whether the Implementation of a pattern dictionary was a structure type.
