severities: []
summary: perltidy through 20160302, as used by perlcritic, check-all-the-things, and
  other software, relies on the current working directory for certain output files
  and does not have a symlink-attack protection mechanism, which allows local users
  to overwrite arbitrary files by creating a symlink, as demonstrated by creating
  a perltidy.ERR symlink that the victim cannot delete.
