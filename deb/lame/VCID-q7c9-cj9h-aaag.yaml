summary: LAME through 3.99.5 relies on the signed integer data type for values in
  a WAV or AIFF header, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (stack-based buffer overflow or heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via a crafted file, as demonstrated by mishandling of num_channels.
