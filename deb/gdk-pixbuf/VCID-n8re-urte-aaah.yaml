summary: Integer overflow in the pixops_scale_nearest function in pixops/pixops.c
  in gdk-pixbuf before 2.32.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted GIF image
  file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
