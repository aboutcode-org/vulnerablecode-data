severities: []
summary: GNOME gdk-pixbuf (aka GdkPixbuf) before 2.42.2 allows a denial of service
  (infinite loop) in lzw.c in the function write_indexes. if c->self_code equals 10,
  self->code_table[10].extends will assign the value 11 to c. The next execution in
  the loop will assign self->code_table[11].extends to c, which will give the value
  of 10. This will make the loop run infinitely. This bug can, for example, be triggered
  by calling this function with a GIF image with LZW compression that is crafted in
  a special way.
