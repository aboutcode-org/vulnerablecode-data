severities: []
summary: add_password in pam_radius_auth.c in pam_radius 1.4.0 does not correctly
  check the length of the input password, and is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer
  overflow during memcpy(). An attacker could send a crafted password to an application
  (loading the pam_radius library) and crash it. Arbitrary code execution might be
  possible, depending on the application, C library, compiler, and other factors.
