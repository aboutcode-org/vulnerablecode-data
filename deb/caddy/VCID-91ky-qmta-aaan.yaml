summary: Caddy through 0.11.0 sends incorrect certificates for certain invalid requests,
  making it easier for attackers to enumerate hostnames. Specifically, when unable
  to match a Host header with a vhost in its configuration, it serves the X.509 certificate
  for a randomly selected vhost in its configuration. Repeated requests (with a nonexistent
  hostname in the Host header) permit full enumeration of all certificates on the
  server. This generally permits an attacker to easily and accurately discover the
  existence of and relationships among hostnames that weren't meant to be public,
  though this information could likely have been discovered via other methods with
  additional effort.
