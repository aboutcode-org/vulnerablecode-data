summary: Qt 5.12.2 through 5.14.2, as used in unofficial builds of Mumble 1.3.0 and
  other products, mishandles OpenSSL's error queue, which can cause a denial of service
  to QSslSocket users. Because errors leak in unrelated TLS sessions, an unrelated
  session may be disconnected when any handshake fails. (Mumble 1.3.1 is not affected,
  regardless of the Qt version.)
