  The supported version that is affected is Java SE: 8u251. Difficult to exploit vulnerability
  allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise

  additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover
  of Java SE. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients
  running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load
  and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the
  Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,
  typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed
  by an administrator). CVSS 3.1 Base Score 8.3 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
