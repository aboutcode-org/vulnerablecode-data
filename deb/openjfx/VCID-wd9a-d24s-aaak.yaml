severities: []
summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
  JavaFX). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1.
  Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access
  via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction
  from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE,
  attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this
  vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE accessible
  data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients
  running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load
  and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the
  Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,
  typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed
  by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.7 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector:
  (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N).'
