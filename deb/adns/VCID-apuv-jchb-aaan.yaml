summary: An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. It fails to ignore apparent
  answers before the first RR that was found the first time. when this is fixed, the
  second answer scan finds the same RRs at the first. Otherwise, adns can be confused
  by interleaving answers for the CNAME target, with the CNAME itself. In that case
  the answer data structure (on the heap) can be overrun. With this fixed, it prefers
  to look only at the answer RRs which come after the CNAME, which is at least arguably
  correct.
