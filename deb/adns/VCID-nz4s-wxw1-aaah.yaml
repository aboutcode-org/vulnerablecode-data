summary: An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. It overruns reading a buffer
  if a domain ends with backslash. If the query domain ended with \, and adns_qf_quoteok_query
  was specified, qdparselabel would read additional bytes from the buffer and try
  to treat them as the escape sequence. It would depart the input buffer and start
  processing many bytes of arbitrary heap data as if it were the query domain. Eventually
  it would run out of input or find some other kind of error, and declare the query
  domain invalid. But before then it might outrun available memory and crash. In principle
  this could be a denial of service attack.
