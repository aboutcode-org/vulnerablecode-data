summary: An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. pap_mailbox822 does not properly
  check st from adns__findlabel_next. Without this, an uninitialised stack value can
  be used as the first label length. Depending on the circumstances, an attacker might
  be able to trick adns into crashing the calling program, leaking aspects of the
  contents of some of its memory, causing it to allocate lots of memory, or perhaps
  overrunning a buffer. This is only possible with applications which make non-raw
  queries for SOA or RP records.
