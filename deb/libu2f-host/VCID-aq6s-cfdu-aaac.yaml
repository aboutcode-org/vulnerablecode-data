severities: []
summary: Yubico libu2f-host 1.1.6 contains unchecked buffers in devs.c, which could
  enable a malicious token to exploit a buffer overflow. An attacker could use this
  to attempt to execute malicious code using a crafted USB device masquerading as
  a security token on a computer where the affected library is currently in use. It
  is not possible to perform this attack with a genuine YubiKey.
