severities: []
summary: xtrlock through 2.10 does not block multitouch events. Consequently, an attacker
  at a locked screen can send input to (and thus control) various programs such as
  Chromium via events such as pan scrolling, "pinch and zoom" gestures, or even regular
  mouse clicks (by depressing the touchpad once and then clicking with a different
  finger).
