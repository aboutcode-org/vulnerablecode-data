summary: Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 NetBeans Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC)
  interpretation is vulnerable for remote command execution (RCE). Using the nashorn
  script engine the environment of the javascript execution for the Proxy Auto-Configuration
  leaks privileged objects, that can be used to circumvent the execution limits. If
  a different script engine was used, no execution limits were in place. Both vectors
  allow remote code execution.
