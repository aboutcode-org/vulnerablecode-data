summary: An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the label-parsing functionality
  of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing compressed labels in mDNS messages,
  the rr_decode function's return value is not checked, leading to a double free that
  could be exploited to execute arbitrary code. An attacker can send an mDNS message
  to trigger this vulnerability.
