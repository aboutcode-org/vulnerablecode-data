summary: An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource record-parsing
  functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing compressed labels in
  mDNS messages, the compression pointer is followed without checking for recursion,
  leading to a denial of service. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger
  this vulnerability.
