summary: An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the message-parsing
  functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing mDNS messages, the implementation
  does not properly keep track of the available data in the message, possibly leading
  to an out-of-bounds read that would result in a denial of service. An attacker can
  send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability.
