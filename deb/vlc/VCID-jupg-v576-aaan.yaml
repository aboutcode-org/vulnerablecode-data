summary: An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the message-parsing
  functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing mDNS messages in mdns_recv,
  the return value of the mdns_read_header function is not checked, leading to an
  uninitialized variable usage that eventually results in a null pointer dereference,
  leading to service crash. An attacker can send a series of mDNS messages to trigger
  this vulnerability.
