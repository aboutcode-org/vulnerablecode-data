severities: []
summary: The CAF demuxer in modules/demux/caf.c in VideoLAN VLC media player 3.0.4
  may read memory from an uninitialized pointer when processing magic cookies in CAF
  files, because a ReadKukiChunk() cast converts a return value to an unsigned int
  even if that value is negative. This could result in a denial of service and/or
  a potential infoleak.
