summary: An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource allocation
  handling of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When encountering errors while parsing
  mDNS messages, some allocated data is not freed, possibly leading to a denial-of-service
  condition via resource exhaustion. An attacker can send one mDNS message repeatedly
  to trigger this vulnerability through decoding of the domain name performed by rr_decode.
