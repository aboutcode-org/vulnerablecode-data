summary: 'An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9. In a variant of CVE-2017-17847,
  signature spoofing is possible for multipart/related messages because a signed message
  part can be referenced with a cid: URI but not actually displayed. In other words,
  the entire containing message appears to be signed, but the recipient does not see
  any of the signed text.'
