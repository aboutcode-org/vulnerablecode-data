summary: The signature verification routine in Enigmail before 2.0.7 interprets user
  ids as status/control messages and does not correctly keep track of the status of
  multiple signatures, which allows remote attackers to spoof arbitrary email signatures
  via public keys containing crafted primary user ids.
