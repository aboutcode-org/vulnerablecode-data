summary: '** DISPUTED ** The OpenPGP specification allows a Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB)
  malleability-gadget attack that can indirectly lead to plaintext exfiltration, aka
  EFAIL. NOTE: third parties report that this is a problem in applications that mishandle
  the Modification Detection Code (MDC) feature or accept an obsolete packet type,
  not a problem in the OpenPGP specification.'
