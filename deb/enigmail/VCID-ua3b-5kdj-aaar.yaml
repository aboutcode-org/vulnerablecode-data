summary: An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9. Signature spoofing is possible
  because the UI does not properly distinguish between an attachment signature, and
  a signature that applies to the entire containing message, aka TBE-01-021. This
  is demonstrated by an e-mail message with an attachment that is a signed e-mail
  message in message/rfc822 format.
