summary: An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9. A remote attacker can obtain
  cleartext content by sending an encrypted data block (that the attacker cannot directly
  decrypt) to a victim, and relying on the victim to automatically decrypt that block
  and then send it back to the attacker as quoted text, aka the TBE-01-005 "replay"
  issue.
