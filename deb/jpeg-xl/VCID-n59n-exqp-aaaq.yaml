summary: For certain valid JPEG XL images with a size slightly larger than an integer
  number of groups (256x256 pixels) when processing the groups out of order the decoder
  can perform an out of bounds copy of image pixels from an image buffer in the heap
  to another. This copy can occur when processing the right or bottom edges of the
  image, but only when groups are processed in certain order. Groups can be processed
  out of order in multi-threaded decoding environments with heavy thread load but
  also with images that contain the groups in an arbitrary order in the file. It is
  recommended to upgrade past 0.6.0 or patch with https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/pull/775
