summary: go-jose before 1.0.4 suffers from multiple signatures exploitation. The go-jose
  library supports messages with multiple signatures. However, when validating a signed
  message the API did not indicate which signature was valid, which could potentially
  lead to confusion. For example, users of the library might mistakenly read protected
  header values from an attached signature that was different from the one originally
  validated.
