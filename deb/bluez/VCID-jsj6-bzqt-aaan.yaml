severities: []
summary: BlueZ is a Bluetooth protocol stack for Linux. In affected versions a vulnerability
  exists in sdp_cstate_alloc_buf which allocates memory which will always be hung
  in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory
  leak over time. The data can be a very large object, which can be caused by an attacker
  continuously sending sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device
  to crash.
