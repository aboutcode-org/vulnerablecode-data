summary: An issue was discovered in bluetoothd in BlueZ through 5.48. The vulnerability
  lies in the handling of a SVC_ATTR_REQ by the SDP implementation. By crafting a
  malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick the server into returning more bytes than
  the buffer actually holds, resulting in leaking arbitrary heap data. The root cause
  can be found in the function service_attr_req of sdpd-request.c. The server does
  not check whether the CSTATE data is the same in consecutive requests, and instead
  simply trusts that it is the same.
