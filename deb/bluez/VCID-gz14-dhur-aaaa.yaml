severities: []
summary: bluetoothd from bluez incorrectly saves adapters' Discoverable status when
  a device is powered down, and restores it when powered up. If a device is powered
  down while discoverable, it will be discoverable when powered on again. This could
  lead to inadvertent exposure of the bluetooth stack to physically nearby attackers.
