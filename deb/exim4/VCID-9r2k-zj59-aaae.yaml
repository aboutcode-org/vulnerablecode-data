summary: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges. Because
  Exim operates as root in the spool directory (owned by a non-root user), an attacker
  can write to a /var/spool/exim4/input spool header file, in which a crafted recipient
  address can indirectly lead to command execution.
