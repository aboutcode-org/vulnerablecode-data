severities: []
summary: The DBD::mysql module through 4.043 for Perl allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (use-after-free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified
  other impact by triggering (1) certain error responses from a MySQL server or (2)
  a loss of a network connection to a MySQL server. The use-after-free defect was
  introduced by relying on incorrect Oracle mysql_stmt_close documentation and code
  examples.
