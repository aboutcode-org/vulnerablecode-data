severities: []
summary: NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2 happily processes a chain of RRDP repositories
  of infinite length causing it to never finish a validation run. In RPKI, a CA can
  choose the RRDP repository it wishes to publish its data in. By continuously generating
  a new child CA that only consists of another CA using a different RRDP repository,
  a malicious CA can create a chain of CAs of de-facto infinite length. Routinator
  prior to version 0.10.2 did not contain a limit on the length of such a chain and
  will therefore continue to process this chain forever. As a result, the validation
  run will never finish, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set
  or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any data
  at all.
