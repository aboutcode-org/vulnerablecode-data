summary: The server daemons in Kannel 1.5.0 and earlier create a PID file after dropping
  privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary
  processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for PID file modification
  before a root script executes a "kill `cat /pathname`" command, as demonstrated
  by bearerbox.
