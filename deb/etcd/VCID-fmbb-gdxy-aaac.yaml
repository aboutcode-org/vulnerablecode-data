severities: []
summary: In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, certain directory paths are created
  (etcd data directory and the directory path when provided to automatically generate
  self-signed certificates for TLS connections with clients) with restricted access
  permissions (700) by using the os.MkdirAll. This function does not perform any permission
  checks when a given directory path exists already. A possible workaround is to ensure
  the directories have the desired permission (700).
