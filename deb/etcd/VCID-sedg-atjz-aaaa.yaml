severities: []
summary: In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, the etcd gateway is a simple TCP
  proxy to allow for basic service discovery and access. However, it is possible to
  include the gateway address as an endpoint. This results in a denial of service,
  since the endpoint can become stuck in a loop of requesting itself until there are
  no more available file descriptors to accept connections on the gateway.
