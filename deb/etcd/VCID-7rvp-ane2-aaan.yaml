severities: []
summary: etcd versions 3.2.x before 3.2.26 and 3.3.x before 3.3.11 are vulnerable
  to an improper authentication issue when role-based access control (RBAC) is used
  and client-cert-auth is enabled. If an etcd client server TLS certificate contains
  a Common Name (CN) which matches a valid RBAC username, a remote attacker may authenticate
  as that user with any valid (trusted) client certificate in a REST API request to
  the gRPC-gateway.
