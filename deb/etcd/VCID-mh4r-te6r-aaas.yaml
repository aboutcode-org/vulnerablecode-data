severities: []
summary: A cross-site request forgery flaw was found in etcd 3.3.1 and earlier. An
  attacker can set up a website that tries to send a POST request to the etcd server
  and modify a key. Adding a key is done with PUT so it is theoretically safe (can't
  PUT from an HTML form or such) but POST allows creating in-order keys that an attacker
  can send.
