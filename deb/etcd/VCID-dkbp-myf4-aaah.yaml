severities: []
summary: In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, it is possible to have an entry
  index greater then the number of entries in the ReadAll method in wal/wal.go. This
  could cause issues when WAL entries are being read during consensus as an arbitrary
  etcd consensus participant could go down from a runtime panic when reading the entry.
