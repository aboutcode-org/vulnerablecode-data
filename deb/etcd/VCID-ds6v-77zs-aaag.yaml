severities: []
summary: In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, a large slice causes panic in
  decodeRecord method. The size of a record is stored in the length field of a WAL
  file and no additional validation is done on this data. Therefore, it is possible
  to forge an extremely large frame size that can unintentionally panic at the expense
  of any RAFT participant trying to decode the WAL.
