severities: []
summary: jwt-go before 4.0.0-preview1 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions
  in situations with []string{} for m["aud"] (which is allowed by the specification).
  Because the type assertion fails, "" is the value of aud. This is a security problem
  if the JWT token is presented to a service that lacks its own audience check.
