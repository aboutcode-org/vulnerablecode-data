summary: In Eclipse Mosquitto 1.4.14, if a Mosquitto instance is set running with
  a configuration file, then sending a HUP signal to server triggers the configuration
  to be reloaded from disk. If there are lots of clients connected so that there are
  no more file descriptors/sockets available (default limit typically 1024 file descriptors
  on Linux), then opening the configuration file will fail.
