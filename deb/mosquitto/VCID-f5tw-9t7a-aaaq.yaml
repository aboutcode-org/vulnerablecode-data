severities: []
summary: In Mosquitto before 1.4.12, pattern based ACLs can be bypassed by clients
  that set their username/client id to '#' or '+'. This allows locally or remotely
  connected clients to access MQTT topics that they do have the rights to. The same
  issue may be present in third party authentication/access control plugins for Mosquitto.
