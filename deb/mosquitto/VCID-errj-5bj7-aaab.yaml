severities: []
summary: When Eclipse Mosquitto version 1.0 to 1.5.5 (inclusive) is configured to
  use a password file for authentication, any malformed data in the password file
  will be treated as valid. This typically means that the malformed data becomes a
  username and no password. If this occurs, clients can circumvent authentication
  and get access to the broker by using the malformed username. In particular, a blank
  line will be treated as a valid empty username. Other security measures are unaffected.
  Users who have only used the mosquitto_passwd utility to create and modify their
  password files are unaffected by this vulnerability.
