severities: []
summary: The Eclipse Mosquitto broker up to version 1.4.15 does not reject strings
  that are not valid UTF-8. A malicious client could cause other clients that do reject
  invalid UTF-8 strings to disconnect themselves from the broker by sending a topic
  string which is not valid UTF-8, and so cause a denial of service for the clients.
