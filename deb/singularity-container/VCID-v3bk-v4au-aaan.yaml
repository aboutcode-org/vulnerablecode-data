summary: An issue was discovered in Singularity 3.1.0 to 3.2.0-rc2, a malicious user
  with local/network access to the host system (e.g. ssh) could exploit this vulnerability
  due to insecure permissions allowing a user to edit files within `/run/singularity/instances/sing/<user>/<instance>`.
  The manipulation of those files can change the behavior of the starter-suid program
  when instances are joined resulting in potential privilege escalation on the host.
