summary: '** DISPUTED ** In Sudo through 1.8.29, the fact that a user has been blocked
  (e.g., by using the ! character in the shadow file instead of a password hash) is
  not considered, allowing an attacker (who has access to a Runas ALL sudoer account)
  to impersonate any blocked user. NOTE: The software maintainer believes that this
  CVE is not valid. Disabling local password authentication for a user is not the
  same as disabling all access to that user--the user may still be able to login via
  other means (ssh key, kerberos, etc). Both the Linux shadow(5) and passwd(1) manuals
  are clear on this. Indeed it is a valid use case to have local accounts that are
  _only_ accessible via sudo and that cannot be logged into with a password. Sudo
  1.8.30 added an optional setting to check the _shell_ of the target user (not the
  encrypted password!) against the contents of /etc/shells but that is not the same
  thing as preventing access to users with an invalid password hash.'
