severities: []
summary: In Sudo before 1.8.26, if pwfeedback is enabled in /etc/sudoers, users can
  trigger a stack-based buffer overflow in the privileged sudo process. (pwfeedback
  is a default setting in Linux Mint and elementary OS; however, it is NOT the default
  for upstream and many other packages, and would exist only if enabled by an administrator.)
  The attacker needs to deliver a long string to the stdin of getln() in tgetpass.c.
