summary: 'sudo, when linked with MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5), does not properly check whether
  a user can currently authenticate to Kerberos, which allows local users to gain
  privileges, in a manner unintended by the sudo security model, via certain KRB5_
  environment variable settings.  NOTE: another researcher disputes this vulnerability,
  stating that the attacker must be "a user, who can already log into your system,
  and can already use sudo."'
