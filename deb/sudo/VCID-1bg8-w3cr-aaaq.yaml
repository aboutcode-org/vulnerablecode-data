severities: []
summary: 'sudo 1.3.5 through 1.7.10p5 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.6p6, when running on systems
  without /proc or the sysctl function with the tty_tickets option enabled, does not
  properly validate the controlling terminal device, which allows local users with
  sudo permissions to hijack the authorization of another terminal via vectors related
  to connecting to the standard input, output, and error file descriptors of another
  terminal.  NOTE: this is one of three closely-related vulnerabilities that were
  originally assigned CVE-2013-1776, but they have been SPLIT because of different
  affected versions.'
