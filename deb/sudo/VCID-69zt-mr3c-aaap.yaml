severities: []
summary: sudo before 1.8.12 does not ensure that the TZ environment variable is associated
  with a zoneinfo file, which allows local users to open arbitrary files for read
  access (but not view file contents) by running a program within an sudo session,
  as demonstrated by interfering with terminal output, discarding kernel-log messages,
  or repositioning tape drives.
