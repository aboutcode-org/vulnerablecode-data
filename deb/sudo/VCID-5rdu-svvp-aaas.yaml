summary: '** DISPUTED ** In Sudo through 1.8.29, an attacker with access to a Runas
  ALL sudoer account can impersonate a nonexistent user by invoking sudo with a numeric
  uid that is not associated with any user. NOTE: The software maintainer believes
  that this is not a vulnerability because running a command via sudo as a user not
  present in the local password database is an intentional feature. Because this behavior
  surprised some users, sudo 1.8.30 introduced an option to enable/disable this behavior
  with the default being disabled. However, this does not change the fact that sudo
  was behaving as intended, and as documented, in earlier versions.'
