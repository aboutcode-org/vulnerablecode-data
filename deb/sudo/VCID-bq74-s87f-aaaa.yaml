severities: []
summary: 'sudo 1.3.5 through 1.7.10 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.5, when the tty_tickets
  option is enabled, does not properly validate the controlling terminal device, which
  allows local users with sudo permissions to hijack the authorization of another
  terminal via vectors related to connecting to the standard input, output, and error
  file descriptors of another terminal.  NOTE: this is one of three closely-related
  vulnerabilities that were originally assigned CVE-2013-1776, but they have been
  SPLIT because of different affected versions.'
