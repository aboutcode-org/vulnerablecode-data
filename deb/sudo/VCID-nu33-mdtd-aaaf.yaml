summary: selinux_edit_copy_tfiles in sudoedit in Sudo before 1.9.5 allows a local
  unprivileged user to gain file ownership and escalate privileges by replacing a
  temporary file with a symlink to an arbitrary file target. This affects SELinux
  RBAC support in permissive mode. Machines without SELinux are not vulnerable.
