summary: 'A certain Fedora patch for parse.c in sudo before 1.7.4p5-1.fc14 on Fedora
  14 does not properly interpret a system group (aka %group) in the sudoers file during
  authorization decisions for a user who belongs to that group, which allows local
  users to leverage an applicable sudoers file and gain root privileges via a sudo
  command. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a CVE-2009-0034 regression.'
