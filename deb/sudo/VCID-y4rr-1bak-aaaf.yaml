severities: []
summary: 'sudo before 1.7.10p5 and 1.8.x before 1.8.6p6, when the tty_tickets option
  is enabled, does not properly validate the controlling terminal device, which allows
  local users with sudo permissions to hijack the authorization of another terminal
  via vectors related to a session without a controlling terminal device and connecting
  to the standard input, output, and error file descriptors of another terminal.  NOTE:
  this is one of three closely-related vulnerabilities that were originally assigned
  CVE-2013-1776, but they have been SPLIT because of different affected versions.'
