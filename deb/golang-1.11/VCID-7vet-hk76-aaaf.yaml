summary: In Go before 1.10.6 and 1.11.x before 1.11.3, the "go get" command is vulnerable
  to directory traversal when executed with the import path of a malicious Go package
  which contains curly braces (both '{' and '}' characters). Specifically, it is only
  vulnerable in GOPATH mode, but not in module mode (the distinction is documented
  at https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_aware_go_get). The attacker can cause an
  arbitrary filesystem write, which can lead to code execution.
