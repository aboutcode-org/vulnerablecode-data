severities: []
summary: It has been discovered that lftp up to and including version 4.8.3 does not
  properly sanitize remote file names, leading to a loss of integrity on the local
  system when reverse mirroring is used. A remote attacker may trick a user to use
  reverse mirroring on an attacker controlled FTP server, resulting in the removal
  of all files in the current working directory of the victim's system.
