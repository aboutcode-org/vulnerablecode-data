summary: 'xterm on Slackware Linux 10.2 stores information that had been displayed
  for a different user account using the same xterm process, which might allow local
  users to bypass file permissions and read other users'' files, or obtain other sensitive
  information, by reading the xterm process memory.  NOTE: it could be argued that
  this is an expected consequence of multiple users sharing the same interactive process,
  in which case this is not a vulnerability.'
