summary: perl-archive-zip is vulnerable to a directory traversal in Archive::Zip.
  It was found that the Archive::Zip module did not properly sanitize paths while
  extracting zip files. An attacker able to provide a specially crafted archive for
  processing could use this flaw to write or overwrite arbitrary files in the context
  of the perl interpreter.
