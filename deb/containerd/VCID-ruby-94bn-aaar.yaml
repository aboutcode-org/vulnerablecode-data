summary: "containerd is a container runtime. A bug was found in containerd versions\
  \ prior to 1.4.8 and 1.5.4 where pulling and extracting a specially-crafted container\
  \ image can result in Unix file permission changes for existing files in the host\u2019\
  s filesystem. Changes to file permissions can deny access to the expected owner\
  \ of the file, widen access to others, or set extended bits like setuid, setgid,\
  \ and sticky. This bug does not directly allow files to be read, modified, or executed\
  \ without an additional cooperating process. This bug has been fixed in containerd\
  \ 1.5.4 and 1.4.8. As a workaround, ensure that users only pull images from trusted\
  \ sources. Linux security modules (LSMs) like SELinux and AppArmor can limit the\
  \ files potentially affected by this bug through policies and profiles that prevent\
  \ containerd from interacting with specific files."
