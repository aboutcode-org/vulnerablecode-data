severities: []
summary: The NFS server (nfsserver) in FreeBSD 8.3 through 10.0 does not acquire locks
  in the proper order when converting a directory file handle to a vnode, which allows
  remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via vectors involving
  a thread that uses the correct locking order.
