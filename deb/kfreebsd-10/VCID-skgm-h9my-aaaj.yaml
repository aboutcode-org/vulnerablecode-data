severities: []
summary: 'The x86-64 kernel system-call functionality in Xen 4.1.2 and earlier, as
  used in Citrix XenServer 6.0.2 and earlier and other products; Oracle Solaris 11
  and earlier; illumos before r13724; Joyent SmartOS before 20120614T184600Z; FreeBSD
  before 9.0-RELEASE-p3; NetBSD 6.0 Beta and earlier; Microsoft Windows Server 2008
  R2 and R2 SP1 and Windows 7 Gold and SP1; and possibly other operating systems,
  when running on an Intel processor, incorrectly uses the sysret path in cases where
  a certain address is not a canonical address, which allows local users to gain privileges
  via a crafted application.  NOTE: because this issue is due to incorrect use of
  the Intel specification, it should have been split into separate identifiers; however,
  there was some value in preserving the original mapping of the multi-codebase coordinated-disclosure
  effort to a single identifier.'
