severities: []
summary: 'lib/viewvc.py in ViewVC 1.0.5 uses the content-type parameter in the HTTP
  request for the Content-Type header in the HTTP response, which allows remote attackers
  to cause content to be misinterpreted by the browser via a content-type parameter
  that is inconsistent with the requested object.  NOTE: this issue might not be a
  vulnerability, since it requires attacker access to the repository that is being
  viewed.'
