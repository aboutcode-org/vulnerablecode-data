severities: []
summary: ViewVC before 1.0.5 provides revision metadata without properly checking
  whether access was intended, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
  by reading (1) forbidden pathnames in the revision view, (2) log history that can
  only be reached by traversing a forbidden object, or (3) forbidden diff view path
  parameters.
