summary: 'viewcvs in ViewCVS 0.9.2 allows remote attackers to set the Content-Type
  header to arbitrary values via the content-type parameter, which can be leveraged
  for cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks, as demonstrated using (1) "text/html",
  or (2) "image/jpeg" with an image that is rendered as HTML by Internet Explorer,
  a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-1062.  NOTE: it was later reported that
  0.9.4 is also affected.'
