severities: []
summary: 'Use-after-free vulnerability in Sendmail before 8.13.8 allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long "header line", which causes a previously
  freed variable to be referenced. NOTE: the original developer has disputed the severity
  of this issue, saying "The only denial of service that is possible here is to fill
  up the disk with core dumps if the OS actually generates different core dumps (which
  is unlikely)... the bug is in the shutdown code (finis()) which leads directly to
  exit(3), i.e., the process would terminate anyway, no mail delivery or receiption
  is affected."'
