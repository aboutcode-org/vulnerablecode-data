severities: []
summary: sendmail before 8.14.4 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a Common
  Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which (1) allows man-in-the-middle attackers
  to spoof arbitrary SSL-based SMTP servers via a crafted server certificate issued
  by a legitimate Certification Authority, and (2) allows remote attackers to bypass
  intended access restrictions via a crafted client certificate issued by a legitimate
  Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
