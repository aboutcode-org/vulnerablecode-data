severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Tcpreplay 4.3.0 beta1. A heap-based buffer over-read
  was triggered in the function dlt_en10mb_encode() of the file plugins/dlt_en10mb/en10mb.c,
  due to inappropriate values in the function memmove(). The length (pktlen + ctx
  -> l2len) can be larger than source value (packet + ctx->l2len) because the function
  fails to ensure the length of a packet is valid. This leads to Denial of Service.
