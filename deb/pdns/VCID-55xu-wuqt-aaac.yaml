summary: pdns before version 4.1.2 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in dnsreplay.
  In the dnsreplay tool provided with PowerDNS Authoritative, replaying a specially
  crafted PCAP file can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, leading to a crash
  and potentially arbitrary code execution. This buffer overflow only occurs when
  the -ecs-stamp option of dnsreplay is used.
