summary: An issue has been found in the API component of PowerDNS Authoritative 4.x
  up to and including 4.0.4 and 3.x up to and including 3.4.11, where some operations
  that have an impact on the state of the server are still allowed even though the
  API has been configured as read-only via the api-readonly keyword. This missing
  check allows an attacker with valid API credentials to flush the cache, trigger
  a zone transfer or send a NOTIFY.
