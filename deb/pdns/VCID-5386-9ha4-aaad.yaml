summary: An issue has been found in PowerDNS before 3.4.11 and 4.0.2, and PowerDNS
  recursor before 3.7.4 and 4.0.4, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to
  cause an abnormal CPU usage load on the PowerDNS server by sending crafted DNS queries,
  which might result in a partial denial of service if the system becomes overloaded.
  This issue is based on the fact that the PowerDNS server parses all records present
  in a query regardless of whether they are needed or even legitimate. A specially
  crafted query containing a large number of records can be used to take advantage
  of that behaviour.
