summary: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server before 3.4.11 and
  4.0.2 allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service by
  opening a large number of TCP connections to the web server. If the web server runs
  out of file descriptors, it triggers an exception and terminates the whole PowerDNS
  process. While it's more complicated for an unauthorized attacker to make the web
  server run out of file descriptors since its connection will be closed just after
  being accepted, it might still be possible.
