summary: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server versions up to and
  including 3.4.10, 4.0.1 allowing an authorized user to crash the server by inserting
  a specially crafted record in a zone under their control then sending a DNS query
  for that record. The issue is due to an integer overflow when checking if the content
  of the record matches the expected size, allowing an attacker to cause a read past
  the buffer boundary.
