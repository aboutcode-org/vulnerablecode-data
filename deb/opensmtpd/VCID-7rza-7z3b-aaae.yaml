severities: []
summary: smtpd/lka_filter.c in OpenSMTPD before 6.8.0p1, in certain configurations,
  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
  daemon crash) via a crafted pattern of client activity, because the filter state
  machine does not properly maintain the I/O channel between the SMTP engine and the
  filters layer.
