severities: []
summary: OpenSMTPD before 6.6.4 allows remote code execution because of an out-of-bounds
  read in mta_io in mta_session.c for multi-line replies. Although this vulnerability
  affects the client side of OpenSMTPD, it is possible to attack a server because
  the server code launches the client code during bounce handling.
