severities: []
summary: In all versions of libyang before 1.0-r5, a stack-based buffer overflow was
  discovered in the way libyang parses YANG files with a leaf of type "identityref".
  An application that uses libyang to parse untrusted YANG files may be vulnerable
  to this flaw, which would allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly
  gain code execution.
