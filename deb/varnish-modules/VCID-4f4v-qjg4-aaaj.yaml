summary: Varnish varnish-modules before 0.17.1 allows remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service (daemon restart) in some configurations. This does not affect
  organizations that only install the Varnish Cache product; however, it is common
  to install both Varnish Cache and varnish-modules. Specifically, an assertion failure
  or NULL pointer dereference can be triggered in Varnish Cache through the varnish-modules
  header.append() and header.copy() functions. For some Varnish Configuration Language
  (VCL) files, this gives remote clients an opportunity to cause a Varnish Cache restart.
  A restart reduces overall availability and performance due to an increased number
  of cache misses, and may cause higher load on backend servers.
