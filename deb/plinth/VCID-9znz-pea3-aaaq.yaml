summary: FreedomBox through 20.13 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
  from the /server-status page of the Apache HTTP Server, because a connection from
  the Tor onion service (or from PageKite) is considered a local connection. This
  affects both the freedombox and plinth packages of some Linux distributions, but
  only if the Apache mod_status module is enabled.
