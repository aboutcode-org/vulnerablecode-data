summary: 'Heap-based buffer overflow in ARM mbed TLS (formerly PolarSSL) 1.3.x before
  1.3.14 and 2.x before 2.1.2 allows remote SSL servers to cause a denial of service
  (client crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long session ticket name
  to the session ticket extension, which is not properly handled when creating a ClientHello
  message to resume a session.  NOTE: this identifier was SPLIT from CVE-2015-5291
