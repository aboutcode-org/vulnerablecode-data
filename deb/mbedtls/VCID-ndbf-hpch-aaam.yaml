summary: An issue was discovered in Arm Mbed TLS before 2.16.6 and 2.7.x before 2.7.15.
  An attacker that can get precise enough side-channel measurements can recover the
  long-term ECDSA private key by (1) reconstructing the projective coordinate of the
  result of scalar multiplication by exploiting side channels in the conversion to
  affine coordinates; (2) using an attack described by Naccache, Smart, and Stern
  in 2003 to recover a few bits of the ephemeral scalar from those projective coordinates
  via several measurements; and (3) using a lattice attack to get from there to the
  long-term ECDSA private key used for the signatures. Typically an attacker would
  have sufficient access when attacking an SGX enclave and controlling the untrusted
  OS.
