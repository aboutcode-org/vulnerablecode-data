summary: An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.25.0 (and before 2.16.9 LTS
  and before 2.7.18 LTS). A NULL algorithm parameters entry looks identical to an
  array of REAL (size zero) and thus the certificate is considered valid. However,
  if the parameters do not match in any way, then the certificate should be considered
  invalid.
