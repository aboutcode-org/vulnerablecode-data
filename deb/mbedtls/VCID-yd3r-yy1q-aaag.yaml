summary: 'An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.24.0. The verification of X.509
  certificates when matching the expected common name (the cn argument of mbedtls_x509_crt_verify)
  with the actual certificate name is mishandled: when the subjecAltName extension
  is present, the expected name is compared to any name in that extension regardless
  of its type. This means that an attacker could impersonate a 4-byte or 16-byte domain
  by getting a certificate for the corresponding IPv4 or IPv6 address (this would
  require the attacker to control that IP address, though).'
