severities: []
summary: Racket is a general-purpose programming language and an ecosystem for language-oriented
  programming. In versions prior to 8.2, code evaluated using the Racket sandbox could
  cause system modules to incorrectly use attacker-created modules instead of their
  intended dependencies. This could allow system functions to be controlled by the
  attacker, giving access to facilities intended to be restricted. This problem is
  fixed in Racket version 8.2. A workaround is available, depending on system settings.
  For systems that provide arbitrary Racket evaluation, external sandboxing such as
  containers limit the impact of the problem. For multi-user evaluation systems, such
  as the `handin-server` system, it is not possible to work around this problem and
  upgrading is required.
