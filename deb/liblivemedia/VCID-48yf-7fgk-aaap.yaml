severities: []
summary: A Denial of Service issue was discovered in the LIVE555 Streaming Media libraries
  as used in Live555 Media Server 0.93. It can cause an RTSPServer crash in handleHTTPCmd_TunnelingPOST,
  when RTSP-over-HTTP tunneling is supported, via x-sessioncookie HTTP headers in
  a GET request and a POST request within the same TCP session. This occurs because
  of a call to an incorrect virtual function pointer in the readSocket function in
  GroupsockHelper.cpp.
