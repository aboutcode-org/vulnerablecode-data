summary: 'GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions
  in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute
  arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the
  ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache
  HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations
  in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution,
  aka "ShellShock."  NOTE: the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169
  has been assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the incorrect
  fix.'
