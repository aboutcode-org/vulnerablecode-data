severities: []
summary: 'GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-025 processes trailing strings after certain
  malformed function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows
  remote attackers to write to files or possibly have unknown other impact via a crafted
  environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH
  sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed
  by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment
  occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution.  NOTE: this vulnerability
  exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271.'
