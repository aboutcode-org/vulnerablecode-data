summary: An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through
  5.0 patch 11. By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its
  real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID.
  However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support "saved
  UID" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution
  in the shell can use "enable -f" for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can
  be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges. However,
  binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.
