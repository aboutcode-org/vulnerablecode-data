summary: 'GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions
  in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute
  arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving
  the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the
  Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations
  in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution.  NOTE:
  this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169,
  and CVE-2014-6277.'
