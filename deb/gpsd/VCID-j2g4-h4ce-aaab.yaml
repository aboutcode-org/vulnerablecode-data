summary: 'The NMEA0183 driver in gpsd before 3.9 allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (daemon termination) and possibly execute arbitrary code via
  a GPS packet with a malformed $GPGGA interpreted sentence that lacks certain fields
  and a terminator.  NOTE: a separate issue in the AIS driver was also reported, but
  it might not be a vulnerability.'
