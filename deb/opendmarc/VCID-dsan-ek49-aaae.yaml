severities: []
summary: OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x allows attacks that inject authentication
  results to provide false information about the domain that originated an e-mail
  message. This is caused by incorrect parsing and interpretation of SPF/DKIM authentication
  results, as demonstrated by the example.net(.example.com substring.
