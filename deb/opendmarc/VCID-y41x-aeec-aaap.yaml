severities: []
summary: OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x through 1.4.0-Beta1 has improper null termination
  in the function opendmarc_xml_parse that can result in a one-byte heap overflow
  in opendmarc_xml when parsing a specially crafted DMARC aggregate report. This can
  cause remote memory corruption when a '\0' byte overwrites the heap metadata of
  the next chunk and its PREV_INUSE flag.
