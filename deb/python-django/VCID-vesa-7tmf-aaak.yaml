summary: The default configuration for the file upload handling system in Django before
  1.4.14, 1.5.x before 1.5.9, 1.6.x before 1.6.6, and 1.7 before release candidate
  3 uses a sequential file name generation process when a file with a conflicting
  name is uploaded, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU
  consumption) by unloading a multiple files with the same name.
