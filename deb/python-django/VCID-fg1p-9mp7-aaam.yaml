severities: []
summary: The verify_exists functionality in the URLField implementation in Django
  before 1.2.7 and 1.3.x before 1.3.1 originally tests a URL's validity through a
  HEAD request, but then uses a GET request for the new target URL in the case of
  a redirect, which might allow remote attackers to trigger arbitrary GET requests
  with an unintended source IP address via a crafted Location header.
