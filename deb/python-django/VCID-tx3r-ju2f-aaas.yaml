  1.5.x before 1.5.2, and 1.6 before beta 2 treats a URL''s scheme as safe even if
  it is not HTTP or HTTPS, which might introduce cross-site scripting (XSS) or other
  vulnerabilities into Django applications that use this function, as demonstrated
  by "the login view in django.contrib.auth.views" and the javascript: scheme.'
