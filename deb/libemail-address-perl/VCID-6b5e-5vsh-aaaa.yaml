summary: 'Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in Address.pm in the Email-Address
  module 1.908 and earlier for Perl allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (CPU consumption) via a crafted string containing a list of e-mail addresses in
  conjunction with parenthesis characters that can be associated with nested comments.
  NOTE: the default configuration in 1.908 mitigates this vulnerability but misparses
  certain realistic comments.'
