summary: An authorization flaw was found in Pacemaker before 1.1.16, where it did
  not properly guard its IPC interface. An attacker with an unprivileged account on
  a Pacemaker node could use this flaw to, for example, force the Local Resource Manager
  daemon to execute a script as root and thereby gain root access on the machine.
