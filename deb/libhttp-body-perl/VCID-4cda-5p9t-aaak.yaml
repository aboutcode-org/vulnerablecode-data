severities: []
summary: HTTP::Body::Multipart in the HTTP-Body 1.08, 1.17, and earlier module for
  Perl uses the part of the uploaded file's name after the first "." character as
  the suffix of a temporary file, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
  attacks by leveraging subsequent behavior that may assume the suffix is well-formed.
