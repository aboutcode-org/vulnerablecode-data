summary: 'mysql_install_db in MariaDB 10.4.7 through 10.4.11 allows privilege escalation
  from the mysql user account to root because chown and chmod are performed unsafely,
  as demonstrated by a symlink attack on a chmod 04755 of auth_pam_tool_dir/auth_pam_tool.
  NOTE: this does not affect the Oracle MySQL product, which implements mysql_install_db
  differently.'
