summary: In Dogtag PKI through 10.8.3, the pki.client.PKIConnection class did not
  enable python-requests certificate validation. Since the verify parameter was hard-coded
  in all request functions, it was not possible to override the setting. As a result,
  tools making use of this class, such as the pki-server command, may have been vulnerable
  to Person-in-the-Middle attacks in certain non-localhost use cases. This is fixed
  in 10.9.0-b1.
