severities: []
summary: Dogtag PKI, through version 10.6.1, has a vulnerability in AAclAuthz.java
  that, under certain configurations, causes the application of ACL allow and deny
  rules to be reversed. If a server is configured to process allow rules before deny
  rules (authz.evaluateOrder=allow,deny), then allow rules will deny access and deny
  rules will grant access. This may result in an escalation of privileges or have
  other unintended consequences.
