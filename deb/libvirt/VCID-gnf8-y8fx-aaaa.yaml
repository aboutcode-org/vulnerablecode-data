summary: It was discovered that libvirtd before versions 4.10.1 and 5.4.1 would permit
  read-only clients to use the virDomainSaveImageGetXMLDesc() API, specifying an arbitrary
  path which would be accessed with the permissions of the libvirtd process. An attacker
  with access to the libvirtd socket could use this to probe the existence of arbitrary
  files, cause denial of service or cause libvirtd to execute arbitrary programs.
