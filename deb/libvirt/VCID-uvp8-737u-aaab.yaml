summary: A NULL pointer dereference was found in the libvirt API responsible introduced
  in upstream version 3.10.0, and fixed in libvirt 6.0.0, for fetching a storage pool
  based on its target path. In more detail, this flaw affects storage pools created
  without a target path such as network-based pools like gluster and RBD. Unprivileged
  users with a read-only connection could abuse this flaw to crash the libvirt daemon,
  resulting in a potential denial of service.
