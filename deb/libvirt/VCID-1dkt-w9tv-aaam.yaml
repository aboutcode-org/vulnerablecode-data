severities: []
summary: An improper locking issue was found in the virStoragePoolLookupByTargetPath
  API of libvirt. It occurs in the storagePoolLookupByTargetPath function where a
  locked virStoragePoolObj object is not properly released on ACL permission failure.
  Clients connecting to the read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use
  this flaw to acquire the lock and prevent other users from accessing storage pool/volume
  APIs, resulting in a denial of service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability
  is to system availability.
