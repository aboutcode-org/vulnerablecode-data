severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in the libvirt nwfilter driver. The virNWFilterObjListNumOfNWFilters
  method failed to acquire the driver->nwfilters mutex before iterating over virNWFilterObj
  instances. There was no protection to stop another thread from concurrently modifying
  the driver->nwfilters object. This flaw allows a malicious, unprivileged user to
  exploit this issue via libvirt's API virConnectNumOfNWFilters to crash the network
  filter management daemon (libvirtd/virtnwfilterd).
