summary: A use-after-free flaw was found in libvirt. The qemuMonitorUnregister() function
  in qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF is called using multiple threads without being adequately
  protected by a monitor lock. This flaw could be triggered by the virConnectGetAllDomainStats
  API when the guest is shutting down. An unprivileged client with a read-only connection
  could use this flaw to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt
  daemon to crash.
