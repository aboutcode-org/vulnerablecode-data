severities: []
summary: A missing authorization flaw was found in the libvirt API responsible for
  changing the QEMU agent response timeout. This flaw allows read-only connections
  to adjust the time that libvirt waits for the QEMU guest agent to respond to agent
  commands. Depending on the timeout value that is set, this flaw can make guest agent
  commands fail because the agent cannot respond in time. Unprivileged users with
  a read-only connection could abuse this flaw to set the response timeout for all
  guest agent messages to zero, potentially leading to a denial of service. This flaw
  affects libvirt versions before 6.2.0.
