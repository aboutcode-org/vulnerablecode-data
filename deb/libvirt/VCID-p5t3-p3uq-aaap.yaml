summary: The remoteClientFreeFunc function in daemon/remote.c in libvirt before 1.1.3,
  when ACLs are used, does not set an identity, which causes event handler removal
  to be denied and remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and
  crash) by registering an event handler and then closing the connection.
