summary: The lxcDomainGetMemoryParameters method in lxc/lxc_driver.c in libvirt 1.0.5
  through 1.2.0 does not properly check the status of LXC guests when reading memory
  tunables, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
  and libvirtd crash) via a guest in the shutdown status, as demonstrated by the "virsh
  memtune" command.
