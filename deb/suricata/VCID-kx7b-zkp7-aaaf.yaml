summary: An issue was discovered in Suricata 5.0.0. It is possible to bypass/evade
  any tcp based signature by overlapping a TCP segment with a fake FIN packet. The
  fake FIN packet is injected just before the PUSH ACK packet we want to bypass. The
  PUSH ACK packet (containing the data) will be ignored by Suricata because it overlaps
  the FIN packet (the sequence and ack number are identical in the two packets). The
  client will ignore the fake FIN packet because the ACK flag is not set. Both linux
  and windows clients are ignoring the injected packet.
