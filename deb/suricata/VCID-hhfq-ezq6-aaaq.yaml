summary: An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.3. The code mishandles the case of
  sending a network packet with the right type, such that the function DecodeEthernet
  in decode-ethernet.c is executed a second time. At this point, the algorithm cuts
  the first part of the packet and doesn't determine the current length. Specifically,
  if the packet is exactly 28 long, in the first iteration it subtracts 14 bytes.
  Then, it is working with a packet length of 14. At this point, the case distinction
  says it is a valid packet. After that it casts the packet, but this packet has no
  type, and the program crashes at the type case distinction.
