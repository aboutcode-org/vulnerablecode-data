summary: A buffer over-read issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.x before 4.1.4. If
  the input of the decode-mpls.c function DecodeMPLS is composed only of a packet
  of source address and destination address plus the correct type field and the right
  number for shim, an attacker can manipulate the control flow, such that the condition
  to leave the loop is true. After leaving the loop, the network packet has a length
  of 2 bytes. There is no validation of this length. Later on, the code tries to read
  at an empty position, leading to a crash.
