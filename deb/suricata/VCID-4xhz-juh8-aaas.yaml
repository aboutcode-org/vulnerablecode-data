severities: []
summary: Suricata before 4.0.4 is prone to an HTTP detection bypass vulnerability
  in detect.c and stream-tcp.c. If a malicious server breaks a normal TCP flow and
  sends data before the 3-way handshake is complete, then the data sent by the malicious
  server will be accepted by web clients such as a web browser or Linux CLI utilities,
  but ignored by Suricata IDS signatures. This mostly affects IDS signatures for the
  HTTP protocol and TCP stream content; signatures for TCP packets will inspect such
  network traffic as usual.
