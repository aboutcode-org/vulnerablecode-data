summary: In Suricata before 4.x, it was possible to trigger lots of redundant checks
  on the content of crafted network traffic with a certain signature, because of DetectEngineContentInspection
  in detect-engine-content-inspection.c. The search engine doesn't stop when it should
  after no match is found; instead, it stops only upon reaching inspection-recursion-limit
  (3000 by default).
