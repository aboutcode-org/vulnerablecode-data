severities: []
summary: In NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2, a validation run can be delayed
  significantly by an RRDP repository by not answering but slowly drip-feeding bytes
  to keep the connection alive. This can be used to effectively stall validation.
  While Routinator has a configurable time-out value for RRDP connections, this time-out
  was only applied to individual read or write operations rather than the complete
  request. Thus, if an RRDP repository sends a little bit of data before that time-out
  expired, it can continuously extend the time it takes for the request to finish.
  Since validation will only continue once the update of an RRDP repository has concluded,
  this delay will cause validation to stall, leading to Routinator continuing to serve
  the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never
  serve any data at all.
