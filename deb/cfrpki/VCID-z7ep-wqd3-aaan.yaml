severities: []
summary: OctoRPKI does not limit the length of a connection, allowing for a slowloris
  DOS attack to take place which makes OctoRPKI wait forever. Specifically, the repository
  that OctoRPKI sends HTTP requests to will keep the connection open for a day before
  a response is returned, but does keep drip feeding new bytes to keep the connection
  alive.
