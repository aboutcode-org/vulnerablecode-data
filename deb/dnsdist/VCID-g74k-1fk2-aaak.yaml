severities: []
summary: An issue has been found in PowerDNS DNSDist before 1.3.3 allowing a remote
  attacker to craft a DNS query with trailing data such that the addition of a record
  by dnsdist, for example an OPT record when adding EDNS Client Subnet, might result
  in the trailing data being smuggled to the backend as a valid record while not seen
  by dnsdist. This is an issue when dnsdist is deployed as a DNS Firewall and used
  to filter some records that should not be received by the backend. This issue occurs
  only when either the 'useClientSubnet' or the experimental 'addXPF' parameters are
  used when declaring a new backend.
