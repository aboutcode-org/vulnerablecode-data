severities: []
summary: An issue has been found in dnsdist before 1.2.0 in the way EDNS0 OPT records
  are handled when parsing responses from a backend. When dnsdist is configured to
  add EDNS Client Subnet to a query, the response may contain an EDNS0 OPT record
  that has to be removed before forwarding the response to the initial client. On
  a 32-bit system, the pointer arithmetic used when parsing the received response
  to remove that record might trigger an undefined behavior leading to a crash.
