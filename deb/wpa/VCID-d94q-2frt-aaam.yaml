severities: []
summary: The implementations of SAE in hostapd and wpa_supplicant are vulnerable to
  side channel attacks as a result of observable timing differences and cache access
  patterns. An attacker may be able to gain leaked information from a side channel
  attack that can be used for full password recovery. Both hostapd with SAE support
  and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.
