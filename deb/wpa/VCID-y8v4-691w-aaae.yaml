severities: []
summary: The implementations of SAE and EAP-pwd in hostapd and wpa_supplicant 2.x
  through 2.8 are vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of observable timing
  differences and cache access patterns when Brainpool curves are used. An attacker
  may be able to gain leaked information from a side-channel attack that can be used
  for full password recovery.
