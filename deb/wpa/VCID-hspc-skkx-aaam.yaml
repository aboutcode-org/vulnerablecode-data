  a crypto library missing explicit validation on imported elements, do not validate
  the scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit. An attacker may complete authentication,
  session key and control of the data connection with a client. Both hostapd with
  SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.4
  are affected. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd
  support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.
