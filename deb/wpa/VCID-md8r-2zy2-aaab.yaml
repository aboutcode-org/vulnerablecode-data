severities: []
summary: The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd EAP Server and wpa_supplicant EAP
  Peer do not validate the scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit. This vulnerability
  may allow an attacker to complete EAP-PWD authentication without knowing the password.
  However, unless the crypto library does not implement additional checks for the
  EC point, the attacker will not be able to derive the session key or complete the
  key exchange. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support
  prior to and including version 2.4 are affected. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support
  and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.
