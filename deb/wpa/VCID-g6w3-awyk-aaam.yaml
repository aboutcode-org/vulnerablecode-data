severities: []
summary: The eap_pwd_process function in eap_server/eap_server_pwd.c in hostapd 2.x
  before 2.6 does not validate that the reassembly buffer is large enough for the
  final fragment when used with (1) an internal EAP server or (2) a RADIUS server
  and EAP-pwd is enabled in a runtime configuration, which allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (process termination) via a large final fragment in
  an EAP-pwd message.
