summary: An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the hostapd 2.6,
  where an attacker could trigger AP to send IAPP location updates for stations, before
  the required authentication process has completed. This could lead to different
  denial of service scenarios, either by causing CAM table attacks, or by leading
  to traffic flapping if faking already existing clients in other nearby Aps of the
  same wireless infrastructure. An attacker can forge Authentication and Association
  Request packets to trigger this vulnerability.
