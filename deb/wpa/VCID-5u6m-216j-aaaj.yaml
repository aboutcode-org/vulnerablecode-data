severities: []
summary: The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd EAP Server, when built against
  a crypto library missing explicit validation on imported elements, do not validate
  the scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit. An attacker may be able to use
  invalid scalar/element values to complete authentication, gaining session key and
  network access without needing or learning the password. Both hostapd with SAE support
  and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.4 are affected.
  Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior
  to and including version 2.7 are affected.
