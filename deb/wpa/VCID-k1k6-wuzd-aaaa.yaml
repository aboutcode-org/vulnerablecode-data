severities: []
summary: The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd and wpa_supplicant are vulnerable
  to side-channel attacks as a result of cache access patterns. All versions of hostapd
  and wpa_supplicant with EAP-PWD support are vulnerable. The ability to install and
  execute applications is necessary for a successful attack. Memory access patterns
  are visible in a shared cache. Weak passwords may be cracked. Versions of hostapd/wpa_supplicant
  2.7 and newer, are not vulnerable to the timing attack described in CVE-2019-9494.
  Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior
  to and including version 2.7 are affected.
