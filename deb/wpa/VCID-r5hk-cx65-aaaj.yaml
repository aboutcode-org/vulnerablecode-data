severities: []
summary: hostapd before 2.10 and wpa_supplicant before 2.10 allow an incorrect indication
  of disconnection in certain situations because source address validation is mishandled.
  This is a denial of service that should have been prevented by PMF (aka management
  frame protection). The attacker must send a crafted 802.11 frame from a location
  that is within the 802.11 communications range.
