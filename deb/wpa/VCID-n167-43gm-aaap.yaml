severities: []
summary: The WNM Sleep Mode code in wpa_supplicant 2.x before 2.6 does not properly
  ignore key data in response frames when management frame protection (MFP) was not
  negotiated, which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary broadcast or multicast
  packets or cause a denial of service (ignored packets) via a WNM Sleep Mode response.
