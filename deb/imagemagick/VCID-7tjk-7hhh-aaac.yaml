summary: In ParseMetaGeometry() of MagickCore/geometry.c, image height and width calculations
  can lead to divide-by-zero conditions which also lead to undefined behavior. This
  flaw can be triggered by a crafted input file processed by ImageMagick and could
  impact application availability. The patch uses multiplication in addition to the
  function `PerceptibleReciprocal()` in order to prevent such divide-by-zero conditions.
  This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
