summary: in SetImageExtent() of /MagickCore/image.c, an incorrect image depth size
  can cause a memory leak because the code which checks for the proper image depth
  size does not reset the size in the event there is an invalid size. The patch resets
  the depth to a proper size before throwing an exception. The memory leak can be
  triggered by a crafted input file that is processed by ImageMagick and could cause
  an impact to application reliability, such as denial of service. This flaw affects
  ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
