summary: WritePALMImage() in /coders/palm.c used size_t casts in several areas of
  a calculation which could lead to values outside the range of representable type
  `unsigned long` undefined behavior when a crafted input file was processed by ImageMagick.
  The patch casts to `ssize_t` instead to avoid this issue. Red Hat Product Security
  marked the Severity as Low because although it could potentially lead to an impact
  to application availability, no specific impact was shown in this case. This flaw
  affects ImageMagick versions prior to ImageMagick 7.0.9-0.
