summary: A floating point math calculation in ScaleAnyToQuantum() of /MagickCore/quantum-private.h
  could lead to undefined behavior in the form of a value outside the range of type
  unsigned long long. The flaw could be triggered by a crafted input file under certain
  conditions when it is processed by ImageMagick. Red Hat Product Security marked
  this as Low because although it could potentially lead to an impact to application
  availability, no specific impact was shown in this case. This flaw affects ImageMagick
  versions prior to 7.0.8-68.
