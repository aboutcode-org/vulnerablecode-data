summary: A flaw was found in ImageMagick in coders/hdr.c. An attacker who submits
  a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior
  in the form of values outside the range of type `unsigned char`. This would most
  likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause
  other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions
  prior to ImageMagick 7.0.8-68.
