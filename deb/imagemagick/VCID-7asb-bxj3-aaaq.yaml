summary: In the CropImage() and CropImageToTiles() routines of MagickCore/transform.c,
  rounding calculations performed on unconstrained pixel offsets was causing undefined
  behavior in the form of integer overflow and out-of-range values as reported by
  UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. Such issues could cause a negative impact to application
  availability or other problems related to undefined behavior, in cases where ImageMagick
  processes untrusted input data. The upstream patch introduces functionality to constrain
  the pixel offsets and prevent these issues. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions
  prior to 7.0.9-0.
