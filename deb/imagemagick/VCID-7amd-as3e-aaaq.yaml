summary: There are several memory leaks in the MIFF coder in /coders/miff.c due to
  improper image depth values, which can be triggered by a specially crafted input
  file. These leaks could potentially lead to an impact to application availability
  or cause a denial of service. It was originally reported that the issues were in
  `AcquireMagickMemory()` because that is where LeakSanitizer detected the leaks,
  but the patch resolves issues in the MIFF coder, which incorrectly handles data
  being passed to `AcquireMagickMemory()`. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions
  prior to 7.0.9-0.
