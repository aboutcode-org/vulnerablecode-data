summary: In CatromWeights(), MeshInterpolate(), InterpolatePixelChannel(), InterpolatePixelChannels(),
  and InterpolatePixelInfo(), which are all functions in /MagickCore/pixel.c, there
  were multiple unconstrained pixel offset calculations which were being used with
  the floor() function. These calculations produced undefined behavior in the form
  of out-of-range and integer overflows, as identified by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.
  These instances of undefined behavior could be triggered by an attacker who is able
  to supply a crafted input file to be processed by ImageMagick. These issues could
  impact application availability or potentially cause other problems related to undefined
  behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
