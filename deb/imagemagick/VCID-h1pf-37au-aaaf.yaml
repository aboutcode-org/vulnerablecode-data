severities: []
summary: 'ImageMagick is free software delivered as a ready-to-run binary distribution
  or as source code that you may use, copy, modify, and distribute in both open and
  proprietary applications. In affected versions and in certain cases, Postscript
  files could be read and written when specifically excluded by a `module` policy
  in `policy.xml`. ex. <policy domain="module" rights="none" pattern="PS" />. The
  issue has been resolved in ImageMagick 7.1.0-7 and in 6.9.12-22. Fortunately, in
  the wild, few users utilize the `module` policy and instead use the `coder` policy
  that is also our workaround recommendation: <policy domain="coder" rights="none"
  pattern="{PS,EPI,EPS,EPSF,EPSI}" />.'
