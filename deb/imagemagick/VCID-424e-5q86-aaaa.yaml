severities: []
summary: In coders/ps.c in ImageMagick 7.0.7-0 Q16, a DoS in ReadPSImage() due to
  lack of an EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU consumption. When a crafted
  PSD file, which claims a large "extent" field in the header but does not contain
  sufficient backing data, is provided, the loop over "length" would consume huge
  CPU resources, since there is no EOF check inside the loop.
