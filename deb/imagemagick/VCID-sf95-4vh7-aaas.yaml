summary: In IntensityCompare() of /MagickCore/quantize.c, a double value was being
  casted to int and returned, which in some cases caused a value outside the range
  of type `int` to be returned. The flaw could be triggered by a crafted input file
  under certain conditions when processed by ImageMagick. Red Hat Product Security
  marked this as Low severity because although it could potentially lead to an impact
  to application availability, no specific impact was shown in this case. This flaw
  affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.
