summary: WriteOnePNGImage() from coders/png.c (the PNG coder) has a for loop with
  an improper exit condition that can allow an out-of-bounds READ via heap-buffer-overflow.
  This occurs because it is possible for the colormap to have less than 256 valid
  values but the loop condition will loop 256 times, attempting to pass invalid colormap
  data to the event logger. The patch replaces the hardcoded 256 value with a call
  to MagickMin() to ensure the proper value is used. This could impact application
  availability when a specially crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. This
  flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.
