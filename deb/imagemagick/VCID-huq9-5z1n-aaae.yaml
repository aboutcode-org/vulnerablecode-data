summary: A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/gem-private.h. An attacker
  who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined
  behavior in the form of values outside the range of type `unsigned char` or division
  by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but
  could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw
  affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
