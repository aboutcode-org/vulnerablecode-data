summary: A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/statistic.c. An attacker who
  submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined
  behavior in the form of values outside the range of type `unsigned long`. This would
  most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially
  cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick
  versions prior to 7.0.8-69.
