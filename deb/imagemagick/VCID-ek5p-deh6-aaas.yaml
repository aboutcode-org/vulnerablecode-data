summary: In RestoreMSCWarning() of /coders/pdf.c there are several areas where calls
  to GetPixelIndex() could result in values outside the range of representable for
  the unsigned char type. The patch casts the return value of GetPixelIndex() to ssize_t
  type to avoid this bug. This undefined behavior could be triggered when ImageMagick
  processes a crafted pdf file. Red Hat Product Security marked this as Low severity
  because although it could potentially lead to an impact to application availability,
  no specific impact was demonstrated in this case. This flaw affects ImageMagick
  versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
