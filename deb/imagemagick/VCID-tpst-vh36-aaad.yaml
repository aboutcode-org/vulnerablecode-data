summary: The PALM image coder at coders/palm.c makes an improper call to AcquireQuantumMemory()
  in routine WritePALMImage() because it needs to be offset by 256. This can cause
  a out-of-bounds read later on in the routine. The patch adds 256 to bytes_per_row
  in the call to AcquireQuantumMemory(). This could cause impact to reliability. This
  flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.
