severities: []
summary: Multiple buffer overflows in cscope 15.5 and earlier allow user-assisted
  attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
  via multiple vectors including (1) a long pathname that is not properly handled
  during file list parsing, (2) long pathnames that result from path variable expansion
  such as tilde expansion for the HOME environment variable, and (3) a long -f (aka
  reffile) command line argument.
