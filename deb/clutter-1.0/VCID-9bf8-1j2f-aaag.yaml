severities: []
summary: The translate_hierarchy_event function in x11/clutter-device-manager-xi2.c
  in Clutter, when resuming the system, does not properly handle XIQueryDevice errors
  when a device has "disappeared," which causes the gnome-shell to crash and allows
  physically proximate attackers to access the previous gnome-shell session via unspecified
  vectors.
