summary: An issue was discovered in Recon-ng before 4.9.5. Lack of validation in the
  modules/reporting/csv.py file allows CSV injection. More specifically, when a Twitter
  user possesses an Excel macro for a username, it will not be properly sanitized
  when exported to a CSV file. This can result in remote code execution for the attacker.
