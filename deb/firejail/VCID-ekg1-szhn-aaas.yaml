summary: 'Firejail before 0.9.44.6 and 0.9.38.x LTS before 0.9.38.10 LTS does not
  comprehensively address dotfile cases during its attempt to prevent accessing user
  files with an euid of zero, which allows local users to conduct sandbox-escape attacks
  via vectors involving a symlink and the --private option. NOTE: this vulnerability
  exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-5180.'
