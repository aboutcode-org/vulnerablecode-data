severities: []
summary: 'Firejail before 0.9.60 allows truncation (resizing to length 0) of the firejail
  binary on the host by running exploit code inside a firejail sandbox and having
  the sandbox terminated. To succeed, certain conditions need to be fulfilled: The
  jail (with the exploit code inside) needs to be started as root, and it also needs
  to be terminated as root from the host (either by stopping it ungracefully (e.g.,
  SIGKILL), or by using the --shutdown control command). This is similar to CVE-2019-5736.'
