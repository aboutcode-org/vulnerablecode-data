severities: []
summary: BomberClone 0.11.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (daemon crash) via (1) a certain malformed PKGF_ackreq packet, which
  triggers a crash in the rscache_add() function in pkgcache.c; and (2) an error packet,
  which is intended to be received by clients and force client shutdown, but also
  triggers server shutdown.
