summary: An exploitable unsafe default configuration vulnerability exists in the TURN
  server functionality of coTURN prior to 4.5.0.9. By default, the TURN server allows
  relaying external traffic to the loopback interface of its own host. This can provide
  access to other private services running on that host, which can lead to further
  attacks. An attacker can set up a relay with a loopback address as the peer on an
  affected TURN server to trigger this vulnerability.
