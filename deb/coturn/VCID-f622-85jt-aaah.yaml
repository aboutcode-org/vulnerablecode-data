summary: In coturn before version 4.5.1.3, there is an issue whereby STUN/TURN response
  buffer is not initialized properly. There is a leak of information between different
  client connections. One client (an attacker) could use their connection to intelligently
  query coturn to get interesting bytes in the padding bytes from the connection of
  another client. This has been fixed in 4.5.1.3.
