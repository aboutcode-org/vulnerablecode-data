summary: An exploitable unsafe default configuration vulnerability exists in the TURN
  server function of coTURN prior to version 4.5.0.9. By default, the TURN server
  runs an unauthenticated telnet admin portal on the loopback interface. This can
  provide administrator access to the TURN server configuration, which can lead to
  additional attacks. An attacker who can get access to the telnet port can gain administrator
  access to the TURN server.
