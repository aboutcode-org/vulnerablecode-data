summary: In Docker Notary before 0.1, the checkRoot function in gotuf/client/client.go
  does not check expiry of root.json files, despite a comment stating that it does.
  Even if a user creates a new root.json file after a key compromise, an attacker
  can produce update files referring to an old root.json file.
