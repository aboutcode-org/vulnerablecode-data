summary: In Docker Notary before 0.1, gotuf/signed/verify.go has a Signature Algorithm
  Not Matched to Key vulnerability. Because an attacker controls the field specifying
  the signature algorithm, they might (for example) be able to forge a signature by
  forcing a misinterpretation of an RSA-PSS key as Ed25519 elliptic-curve data.
