summary: In Xpdf 4.01.01, a heap-based buffer over-read could be triggered in strncpy
  from FoFiType1::parse in fofi/FoFiType1.cc because it does not ensure the source
  string has a valid length before making a fixed-length copy. It can, for example,
  be triggered by sending a crafted PDF document to the pdftotext tool. It allows
  an attacker to use a crafted pdf file to cause Denial of Service or an information
  leak, or possibly have unspecified other impact.
