severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in phpLiteAdmin 1.9.5 through 1.9.7.1. Due to loose
  comparison with '==' instead of '===' in classes/Authorization.php for the user-provided
  login password, it is possible to login with a simpler password if the password
  has the form of a power in scientific notation (like '2e2' for '200' or '0e1234'
  for '0'). This is possible because, in the loose comparison case, PHP interprets
  the string as a number in scientific notation, and thus converts it to a number.
  After that, the comparison with '==' casts the user input (e.g., the string '200'
  or '0') to a number, too. Hence the attacker can login with just a '0' or a simple
  number he has to brute force. Strong comparison with '===' prevents the cast into
  numbers.
