severities: []
summary: The _checkPolkitPrivilege function in serviceHelper.py in Back In Time (aka
  backintime) 1.1.18 and earlier uses a deprecated polkit authorization method (unix-process)
  that is subject to a race condition (time of check, time of use). With this authorization
  method, the owner of a process requesting a polkit operation is checked by polkitd
  via /proc/<pid>/status, by which time the requesting process may have been replaced
  by a different process with the same PID that has different privileges then the
  original requester.
