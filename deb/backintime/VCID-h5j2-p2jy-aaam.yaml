severities: []
summary: backintime (aka Back in Time) before 1.1.24 did improper escaping/quoting
  of file paths used as arguments to the 'notify-send' command, leading to some parts
  of file paths being executed as shell commands within an os.system call in qt4/plugins/notifyplugin.py.
  This could allow an attacker to craft an unreadable file with a specific name to
  run arbitrary shell commands.
