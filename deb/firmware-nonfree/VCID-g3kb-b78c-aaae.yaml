summary: The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and
  WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that all fragments of a
  frame are encrypted under the same key. An adversary can abuse this to decrypt selected
  fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP
  encryption key is periodically renewed.
