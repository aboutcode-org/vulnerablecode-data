summary: The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and
  WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in
  the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving
  non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can
  abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.
