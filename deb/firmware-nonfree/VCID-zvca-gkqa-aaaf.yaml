summary: The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and
  WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that received fragments
  be cleared from memory after (re)connecting to a network. Under the right circumstances,
  when another device sends fragmented frames encrypted using WEP, CCMP, or GCMP,
  this can be abused to inject arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrate user data.
