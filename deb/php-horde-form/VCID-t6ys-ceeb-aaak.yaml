summary: This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create arbitrary files on affected
  installations of Horde Groupware Webmail Edition 5.2.22. Authentication is required
  to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within add.php. The issue
  results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can allow
