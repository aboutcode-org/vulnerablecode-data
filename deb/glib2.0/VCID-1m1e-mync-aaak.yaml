severities: []
summary: 'GSocketClient in GNOME GLib through 2.62.4 may occasionally connect directly
  to a target address instead of connecting via a proxy server when configured to
  do so, because the proxy_addr field is mishandled. This bug is timing-dependent
  and may occur only sporadically depending on network delays. The greatest security
  relevance is in use cases where a proxy is used to help with privacy/anonymity,
  even though there is no technical barrier to a direct connection. NOTE: versions
  before 2.60 are unaffected.'
