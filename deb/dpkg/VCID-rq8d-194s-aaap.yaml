summary: 'dpkg 1.15.9, 1.16.x before 1.16.14, and 1.17.x before 1.17.9 expect the
  patch program to be compliant with a need for the "C-style encoded filenames" feature,
  but is supported in environments with noncompliant patch programs, which triggers
  an interaction error that allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal
  attacks and modify files outside of the intended directories via a crafted source
  package. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of reliance on unrealistic constraints
  on the behavior of an external program.'
