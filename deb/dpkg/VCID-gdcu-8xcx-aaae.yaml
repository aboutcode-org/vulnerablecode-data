severities: []
summary: dpkg-source in dpkg 1.3.0 through 1.18.23 is able to use a non-GNU patch
  program and does not offer a protection mechanism for blank-indented diff hunks,
  which allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks via a crafted
  Debian source package, as demonstrated by use of dpkg-source on NetBSD.
