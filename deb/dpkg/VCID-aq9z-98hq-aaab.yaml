summary: 'dpkg 1.15.9 on Debian squeeze introduces support for the "C-style encoded
  filenames" feature without recognizing that the squeeze patch program lacks this
  feature, which triggers an interaction error that allows remote attackers to conduct
  directory traversal attacks and modify files outside of the intended directories
  via a crafted source package.  NOTE: this can be considered a release engineering
  problem in the effort to fix CVE-2014-0471.'
