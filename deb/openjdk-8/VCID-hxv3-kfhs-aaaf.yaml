  vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some
  of Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
  typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed
  Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet)
  and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to
  Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g.,
  code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.3 (Integrity impacts).
