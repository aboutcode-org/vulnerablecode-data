summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
  Javadoc). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u161, 7u151, 8u144
  and 9. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network
  access via HTTP to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction
  from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE,
  attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this
  vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some
  of Java SE accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Java
  SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically
  in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets,
  that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely
  on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,
  typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed
  by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.1 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts).
  CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).'
