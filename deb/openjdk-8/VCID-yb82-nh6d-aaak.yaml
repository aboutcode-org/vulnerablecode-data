summary: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, does not
  properly combine state data with key data during the initialization phase, which
  makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks against
  the initial bytes of a stream by sniffing network traffic that occasionally relies
  on keys affected by the Invariance Weakness, and then using a brute-force approach
  involving LSB values, aka the "Bar Mitzvah" issue.
