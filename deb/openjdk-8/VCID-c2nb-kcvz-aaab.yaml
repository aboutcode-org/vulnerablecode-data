  can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial
  DOS) of Java SE. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically
  in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets
  (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the
  internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not
  apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted
  code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.1 (Availability
