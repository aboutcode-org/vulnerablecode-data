summary: stunnel before 5.00, when using fork threading, does not properly update
  the state of the OpenSSL pseudo-random number generator (PRNG), which causes subsequent
  children with the same process ID to use the same entropy pool and allows remote
  attackers to obtain private keys for EC (ECDSA) or DSA certificates.
