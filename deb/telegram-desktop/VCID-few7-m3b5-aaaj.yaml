severities: []
summary: Telegram Desktop before 1.5.12 on Windows, and the Telegram applications
  for Android, iOS, and Linux, is vulnerable to an IDN homograph attack when displaying
  messages containing URLs. This occurs because the application produces a clickable
  link even if (for example) Latin and Cyrillic characters exist in the same domain
  name, and the available font has an identical representation of characters from
  different alphabets.
