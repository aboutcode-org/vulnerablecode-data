summary: An issue was discovered in openfortivpn 1.11.0 when used with OpenSSL 1.0.2
  or later. tunnel.c mishandles certificate validation because the hostname check
  operates on uninitialized memory. The outcome is that a valid certificate is never
  accepted (only a malformed certificate may be accepted).
