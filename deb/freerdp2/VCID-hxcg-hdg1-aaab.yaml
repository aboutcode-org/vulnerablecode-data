severities: []
summary: In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.1.2, an integer overflow exists due to
  missing input sanitation in rdpegfx channel. All FreeRDP clients are affected. The
  input rectangles from the server are not checked against local surface coordinates
  and blindly accepted. A malicious server can send data that will crash the client
  later on (invalid length arguments to a `memcpy`) This has been fixed in 2.2.0.
  As a workaround, stop using command line arguments /gfx, /gfx-h264 and /network:auto
