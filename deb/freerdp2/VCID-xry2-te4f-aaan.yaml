summary: In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, an Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow
  exists. When using /video redirection, a manipulated server can instruct the client
  to allocate a buffer with a smaller size than requested due to an integer overflow
  in size calculation. With later messages, the server can manipulate the client to
  write data out of bound to the previously allocated buffer. This has been patched
  in 2.1.0.
