summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released
  under the Apache license. In affected versions a malicious server might trigger
  out of bound writes in a connected client. Connections using GDI or SurfaceCommands
  to send graphics updates to the client might send `0` width/height or out of bound
  rectangles to trigger out of bound writes. With `0` width or heigth the memory allocation
  will be `0` but the missing bounds checks allow writing to the pointer at this (not
  allocated) region. This issue has been patched in FreeRDP 2.4.1.
