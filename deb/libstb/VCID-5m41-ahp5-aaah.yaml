severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in stb stb_image.h 2.27. The PNM loader incorrectly
  interpreted 16-bit PGM files as 8-bit when converting to RGBA, leading to a buffer
  overflow when later reinterpreting the result as a 16-bit buffer. An attacker could
  potentially have crashed a service using stb_image, or read up to 1024 bytes of
  non-consecutive heap data without control over the read location.
