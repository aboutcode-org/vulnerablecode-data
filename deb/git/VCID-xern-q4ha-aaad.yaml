summary: In Git before 2.13.7, 2.14.x before 2.14.4, 2.15.x before 2.15.2, 2.16.x
  before 2.16.4, and 2.17.x before 2.17.1, remote code execution can occur. With a
  crafted .gitmodules file, a malicious project can execute an arbitrary script on
  a machine that runs "git clone --recurse-submodules" because submodule "names" are
  obtained from this file, and then appended to $GIT_DIR/modules, leading to directory
  traversal with "../" in a name. Finally, post-checkout hooks from a submodule are
  executed, bypassing the intended design in which hooks are not obtained from a remote
  server.
