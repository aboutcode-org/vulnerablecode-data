severities: []
summary: In Pure-FTPd before 1.0.50, an incorrect max_filesize quota mechanism in
  the server allows attackers to upload files of unbounded size, which may lead to
  denial of service or a server hang. This occurs because a certain greater-than-zero
  test does not anticipate an initial -1 value. (Versions 1.0.23 through 1.0.49 are
  affected.)
