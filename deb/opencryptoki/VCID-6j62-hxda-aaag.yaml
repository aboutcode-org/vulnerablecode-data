summary: A flaw was found in openCryptoki. The openCryptoki Soft token does not check
  if an EC key is valid when an EC key is created via C_CreateObject, nor when C_DeriveKey
  is used with ECDH public data. This may allow a malicious user to extract the private
  key by performing an invalid curve attack.
