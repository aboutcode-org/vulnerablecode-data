summary: 'Privilege escalation can occur in the SUSE useradd.c code in useradd, as
  distributed in the SUSE shadow package through 4.2.1-27.9.1 for SUSE Linux Enterprise
  12 (SLE-12) and through 4.5-5.39 for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 (SLE-15). Non-existing
  intermediate directories are created with mode 0777 during user creation. Given
  that they are world-writable, local attackers might use this for privilege escalation
  and other unspecified attacks.  NOTE: this would affect non-SUSE users who took
  useradd.c code from a 2014-04-02 upstream pull request; however, no non-SUSE distribution
  is known to be affected.'
