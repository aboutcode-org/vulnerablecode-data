severities: []
summary: The Debian shadow package before 1:4.5-1 for Shadow incorrectly lists pts/0
  and pts/1 as physical terminals in /etc/securetty. This allows local users to login
  as password-less users even if they are connected by non-physical means such as
  SSH (hence bypassing PAM's nullok_secure configuration). This notably affects environments
  such as virtual machines automatically generated with a default blank root password,
  allowing all local users to escalate privileges.
