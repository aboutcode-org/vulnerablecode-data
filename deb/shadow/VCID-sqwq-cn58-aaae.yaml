severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid
  and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2)
  is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary
  group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has
  used "group blacklisting" (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This
  flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups
  knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.
