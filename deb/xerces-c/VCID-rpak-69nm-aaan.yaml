summary: The Apache Xerces-C 3.0.0 to 3.2.3 XML parser contains a use-after-free error
  triggered during the scanning of external DTDs. This flaw has not been addressed
  in the maintained version of the library and has no current mitigation other than
  to disable DTD processing. This can be accomplished via the DOM using a standard
  parser feature, or via SAX using the XERCES_DISABLE_DTD environment variable.
