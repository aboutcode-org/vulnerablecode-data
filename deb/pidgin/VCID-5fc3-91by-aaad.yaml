summary: An information leak exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol in Pidgin.
  Specially crafted MXIT data sent via the server could potentially result in an out-of-bounds
  read. A malicious user, server, or man-in-the-middle attacker can send an invalid
  size for a file transfer which will trigger an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
  This could result in a denial of service or copy data from memory to the file, resulting
  in an information leak if the file is sent to another user.
