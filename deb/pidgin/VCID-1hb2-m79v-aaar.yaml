summary: The g_markup_escape_text function in the SILC protocol plug-in in libpurple
  2.10.0 and earlier, as used in Pidgin and possibly other products, allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via invalid UTF-8 sequences that
  trigger use of invalid pointers and an out-of-bounds read, related to interactions
  with certain versions of glib2.
