summary: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol
  in Pidgin. Specially crafted MXIT data sent from the server could potentially result
  in arbitrary code execution. A malicious server or an attacker who intercepts the
  network traffic can send an invalid size for a packet which will trigger a buffer
  overflow.
