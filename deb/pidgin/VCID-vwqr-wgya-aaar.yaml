summary: The (1) bundled GnuTLS SSL/TLS plugin and the (2) bundled OpenSSL SSL/TLS
  plugin in libpurple in Pidgin before 2.10.10 do not properly consider the Basic
  Constraints extension during verification of X.509 certificates from SSL servers,
  which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information
  via a crafted certificate.
