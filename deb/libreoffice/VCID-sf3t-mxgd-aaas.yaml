summary: 'LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros within
  documents, presenting visual aids that no alteration of the document occurred since
  the last signing and that the signature is valid. An Improper Certificate Validation
  vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed an attacker to modify a digitally signed ODF
  document to insert an additional signing time timestamp which LibreOffice would
  incorrectly present as a valid signature signed at the bogus signing time. This
  issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7-0 versions prior to 7.0.6;
  7-1 versions prior to 7.1.2.'
