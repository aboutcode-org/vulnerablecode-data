severities: []
summary: The get_app_path function in desktop/unx/source/start.c in LibreOffice through
  6.0.5 mishandles the realpath function in certain environments such as FreeBSD libc,
  which might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application
  crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact if LibreOffice is automatically
  launched during web browsing with pathnames controlled by a remote web site.
