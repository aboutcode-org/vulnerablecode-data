summary: By exploiting the way Apache OpenOffice before 4.1.4 renders embedded objects,
  an attacker could craft a document that allows reading in a file from the user's
  filesystem. Information could be retrieved by the attacker by, e.g., using hidden
  sections to store the information, tricking the user into saving the document and
  convincing the user to send the document back to the attacker. The vulnerability
  is mitigated by the need for the attacker to know the precise file path in the target
  system, and the need to trick the user into saving the document and sending it back.
