summary: 'LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros within
  documents, presenting visual aids that no alteration of the document occurred since
  the last signing and that the signature is valid. An Improper Certificate Validation
  vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed an attacker to create a digitally signed ODF
  document, by manipulating the documentsignatures.xml or macrosignatures.xml stream
  within the document to combine multiple certificate data, which when opened caused
  LibreOffice to display a validly signed indicator but whose content was unrelated
  to the signature shown. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice
  7-0 versions prior to 7.0.6; 7-1 versions prior to 7.1.2.'
