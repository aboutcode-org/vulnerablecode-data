summary: 'A vulnerability in LibreOffice hyperlink processing allows an attacker to
  construct documents containing hyperlinks pointing to the location of an executable
  on the target users file system. If the hyperlink is activated by the victim the
  executable target is unconditionally launched. Under Windows and macOS when processing
  a hyperlink target explicitly activated by the user there was no judgment made on
  whether the target was an executable file, so such executable targets were launched
  unconditionally. This issue affects: All LibreOffice Windows and macOS versions
  prior to 6.1.6; LibreOffice Windows and macOS versions in the 6.2 series prior to
  6.2.3.'
