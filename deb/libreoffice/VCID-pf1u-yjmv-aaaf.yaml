summary: 'LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed
  macros can be executed on various script events such as mouse-over, document-open
  etc. Access is intended to be restricted to scripts under the share/Scripts/python,
  user/Scripts/python sub-directories of the LibreOffice install. Protection was added,
  to address CVE-2019-9852, to avoid a directory traversal attack where scripts in
  arbitrary locations on the file system could be executed by employing a URL encoding
  attack to defeat the path verification step. However this protection could be bypassed
  by taking advantage of a flaw in how LibreOffice assembled the final script URL
  location directly from components of the passed in path as opposed to solely from
  the sanitized output of the path verification step. This issue affects: Document
  Foundation LibreOffice 6.2 versions prior to 6.2.7; 6.3 versions prior to 6.3.1.'
