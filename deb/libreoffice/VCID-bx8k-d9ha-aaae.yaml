summary: 'If LibreOffice has an encrypted document open and crashes, that document
  is auto-saved encrypted. On restart, LibreOffice offers to restore the document
  and prompts for the password to decrypt it. If the recovery is successful, and if
  the file format of the recovered document was not LibreOffice''s default ODF file
  format, then affected versions of LibreOffice default that subsequent saves of the
  document are unencrypted. This may lead to a user accidentally saving a MSOffice
  file format document unencrypted while believing it to be encrypted. This issue
  affects: LibreOffice 6-3 series versions prior to 6.3.6; 6-4 series versions prior
  to 6.4.3.'
