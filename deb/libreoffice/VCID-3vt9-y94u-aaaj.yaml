summary: 'LibreOffice is typically bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle vector
  graphics script, which can execute arbitrary python commands contained with the
  document it is launched from. LibreOffice also has a feature where documents can
  specify that pre-installed scripts can be executed on various document script events
  such as mouse-over, etc. Protection was added to block calling LibreLogo from script
  event handers. However a Windows 8.3 path equivalence handling flaw left LibreOffice
  vulnerable under Windows that a document could trigger executing LibreLogo via a
  Windows filename pseudonym. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice
  6.2 versions prior to 6.2.7; 6.3 versions prior to 6.3.1.'
