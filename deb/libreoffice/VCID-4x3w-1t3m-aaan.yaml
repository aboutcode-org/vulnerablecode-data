summary: 'LibreOffice is typically bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle vector
  graphics script, which can execute arbitrary python commands contained with the
  document it is launched from. Protection was added, to address CVE-2019-9848, to
  block calling LibreLogo from document event script handers, e.g. mouse over. However
  LibreOffice also has a separate feature where documents can specify that pre-installed
  scripts can be executed on various global script events such as document-open, etc.
  In the fixed versions, global script event handlers are validated equivalently to
  document script event handlers. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice
  versions prior to 6.2.6.'
