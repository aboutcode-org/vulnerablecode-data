summary: 'ODF documents can contain forms to be filled out by the user. Similar to
  HTML forms, the contained form data can be submitted to a URI, for example, to an
  external web server. To create submittable forms, ODF implements the XForms W3C
  standard, which allows data to be submitted without the need for macros or other
  active scripting Prior to version 6.4.4 LibreOffice allowed forms to be submitted
  to any URI, including file: URIs, enabling form submissions to overwrite local files.
  User-interaction is required to submit the form, but to avoid the possibility of
  malicious documents engineered to maximize the possibility of inadvertent user submission
  this feature has now been limited to http[s] URIs, removing the possibility to overwrite
  local files. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior
  to 6.4.4.'
