summary: 'LibreOffice is typically bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle vector
  graphics script, which can execute arbitrary python commands contained with the
  document it is launched from. LibreOffice also has a feature where documents can
  specify that pre-installed scripts can be executed on various document script events
  such as mouse-over, etc. Protection was added, to address CVE-2019-9848, to block
  calling LibreLogo from script event handers. However an insufficient url validation
  vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed malicious to bypass that protection and again
  trigger calling LibreLogo from script event handlers. This issue affects: Document
  Foundation LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.6.'
