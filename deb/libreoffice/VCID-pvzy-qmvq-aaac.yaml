summary: 'LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed
  macros can be executed on various script events such as mouse-over, document-open
  etc. Access is intended to be restricted to scripts under the share/Scripts/python,
  user/Scripts/python sub-directories of the LibreOffice install. Protection was added,
  to address CVE-2018-16858, to avoid a directory traversal attack where scripts in
  arbitrary locations on the file system could be executed. However this new protection
  could be bypassed by a URL encoding attack. In the fixed versions, the parsed url
  describing the script location is correctly encoded before further processing. This
  issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.6.'
