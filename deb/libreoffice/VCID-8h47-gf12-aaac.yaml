summary: 'LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed
  scripts can be executed on various document events such as mouse-over, etc. LibreOffice
  is typically also bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle vector graphics
  script, which can be manipulated into executing arbitrary python commands. By using
  the document event feature to trigger LibreLogo to execute python contained within
  a document a malicious document could be constructed which would execute arbitrary
  python commands silently without warning. In the fixed versions, LibreLogo cannot
  be called from a document event handler. This issue affects: Document Foundation
  LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.5.'
