severities: []
summary: The X.Org X wrapper (xserver-wrapper.c) in Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu Linux
  does not properly verify the TTY of a user who is starting X, which allows local
  users to bypass intended access restrictions by associating stdin with a file that
  is misinterpreted as the console TTY.
