summary: The Noise protocol implementation suffers from weakened cryptographic security
  after encrypting 2^64 messages, and a potential denial of service attack. After
  2^64 (~18.4 quintillion) messages are encrypted with the Encrypt function, the nonce
  counter will wrap around, causing multiple messages to be encrypted with the same
  key and nonce. In a separate issue, the Decrypt function increments the nonce state
  even when it fails to decrypt a message. If an attacker can provide an invalid input
  to the Decrypt function, this will cause the nonce state to desynchronize between
  the peers, resulting in a failure to encrypt all subsequent messages.
