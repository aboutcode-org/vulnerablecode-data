summary: An issue was discovered in Exempi before 2.4.3. The VPXChunk class in XMPFiles/source/FormatSupport/WEBP_Support.cpp
  does not ensure nonzero widths and heights, which allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (assertion failure and application exit) via a crafted .webp
  file.
