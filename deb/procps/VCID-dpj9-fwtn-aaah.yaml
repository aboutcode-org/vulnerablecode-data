severities: []
summary: procps-ng before version 3.3.15 is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow
  in pgrep. This vulnerability is mitigated by FORTIFY, as it involves strncat() to
  a stack-allocated string. When pgrep is compiled with FORTIFY (as on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux and Fedora), the impact is limited to a crash.
