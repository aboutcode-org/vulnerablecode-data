summary: mutt_ssl.c in mutt 1.5.19 and 1.5.20, when OpenSSL is used, does not properly
  handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field
  of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary
  SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority,
  a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
