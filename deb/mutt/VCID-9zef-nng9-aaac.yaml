severities: []
summary: rfc822.c in Mutt through 2.0.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (mailbox unavailability) by sending email messages with sequences of
  semicolon characters in RFC822 address fields (aka terminators of empty groups).
  A small email message from the attacker can cause large memory consumption, and
  the victim may then be unable to see email messages from other persons.
