severities: []
summary: Versions of MCollective prior to 2.10.4 deserialized YAML from agents without
  calling safe_load, allowing the potential for arbitrary code execution on the server.
  The fix for this is to call YAML.safe_load on input. This has been tested in all
  Puppet-supplied MCollective plugins, but there is a chance that third-party plugins
  could rely on this insecure behavior.
