severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in the server in OpenLDAP before 2.4.48. When the
  server administrator delegates rootDN (database admin) privileges for certain databases
  but wants to maintain isolation (e.g., for multi-tenant deployments), slapd does
  not properly stop a rootDN from requesting authorization as an identity from another
  database during a SASL bind or with a proxyAuthz (RFC 4370) control. (It is not
  a common configuration to deploy a system where the server administrator and a DB
  administrator enjoy different levels of trust.)
