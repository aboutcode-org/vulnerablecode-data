severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenLDAP 2.x before 2.4.48. When using SASL authentication
  and session encryption, and relying on the SASL security layers in slapd access
  controls, it is possible to obtain access that would otherwise be denied via a simple
  bind for any identity covered in those ACLs. After the first SASL bind is completed,
  the sasl_ssf value is retained for all new non-SASL connections. Depending on the
  ACL configuration, this can affect different types of operations (searches, modifications,
  etc.). In other words, a successful authorization step completed by one user affects
  the authorization requirement for a different user.
