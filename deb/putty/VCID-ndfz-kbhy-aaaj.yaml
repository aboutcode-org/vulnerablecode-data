severities: []
summary: The ssh_agent_channel_data function in PuTTY before 0.68 allows remote attackers
  to have unspecified impact via a large length value in an agent protocol message
  and leveraging the ability to connect to the Unix-domain socket representing the
  forwarded agent connection, which trigger a buffer overflow.
