severities: []
summary: PuTTY through 0.75 proceeds with establishing an SSH session even if it has
  never sent a substantive authentication response. This makes it easier for an attacker-controlled
  SSH server to present a later spoofed authentication prompt (that the attacker can
  use to capture credential data, and use that data for purposes that are undesired
  by the client user).
