summary: 'PuTTY before 0.75 on Windows allows remote servers to cause a denial of
  service (Windows GUI hang) by telling the PuTTY window to change its title repeatedly
  at high speed, which results in many SetWindowTextA or SetWindowTextW calls. NOTE:
  the same attack methodology may affect some OS-level GUIs on Linux or other platforms
  for similar reasons.'
