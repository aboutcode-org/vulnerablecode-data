severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in the USB redirector device (usb-redir) of QEMU. Small
  USB packets are combined into a single, large transfer request, to reduce the overhead
  and improve performance. The combined size of the bulk transfer is used to dynamically
  allocate a variable length array (VLA) on the stack without proper validation. Since
  the total size is not bounded, a malicious guest could use this flaw to influence
  the array length and cause the QEMU process to perform an excessive allocation on
  the stack, resulting in a denial of service.
