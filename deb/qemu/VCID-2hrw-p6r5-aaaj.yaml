severities: []
summary: An integer overflow was found in the QEMU implementation of VMWare's paravirtual
  RDMA device in versions prior to 6.1.0. The issue occurs while handling a "PVRDMA_REG_DSRHIGH"
  write from the guest due to improper input validation. This flaw allows a privileged
  guest user to make QEMU allocate a large amount of memory, resulting in a denial
  of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
