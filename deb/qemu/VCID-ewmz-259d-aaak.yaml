severities: []
summary: Multiple integer overflows in the block drivers in QEMU, possibly before
  2.0.0, allow local users to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted catalog
  size in (1) the parallels_open function in block/parallels.c or (2) bochs_open function
  in bochs.c, a large L1 table in the (3) qcow2_snapshot_load_tmp in qcow2-snapshot.c
  or (4) qcow2_grow_l1_table function in qcow2-cluster.c, (5) a large request in the
  bdrv_check_byte_request function in block.c and other block drivers, (6) crafted
  cluster indexes in the get_refcount function in qcow2-refcount.c, or (7) a large
  number of blocks in the cloop_open function in cloop.c, which trigger buffer overflows,
  memory corruption, large memory allocations and out-of-bounds read and writes.
