severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in qemu Media Transfer Protocol (MTP). The code opening
  files in usb_mtp_get_object and usb_mtp_get_partial_object and directories in usb_mtp_object_readdir
  doesn't consider that the underlying filesystem may have changed since the time
  lstat(2) was called in usb_mtp_object_alloc, a classical TOCTTOU problem. An attacker
  with write access to the host filesystem shared with a guest can use this property
  to navigate the host filesystem in the context of the QEMU process and read any
  file the QEMU process has access to. Access to the filesystem may be local or via
  a network share protocol such as CIFS.
