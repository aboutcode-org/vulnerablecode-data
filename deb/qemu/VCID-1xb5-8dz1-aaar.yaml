severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in the USB redirector device emulation of QEMU in versions
  prior to 6.1.0-rc2. It occurs when dropping packets during a bulk transfer from
  a SPICE client due to the packet queue being full. A malicious SPICE client could
  use this flaw to make QEMU call free() with faked heap chunk metadata, resulting
  in a crash of QEMU or potential code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process
  on the host.
