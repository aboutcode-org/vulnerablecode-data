severities: []
summary: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in NBD server implementation
  in qemu before 2.11 allowing a client to request an export name of size up to 4096
  bytes, which in fact should be limited to 256 bytes, causing an out-of-bounds stack
  write in the qemu process. If NBD server requires TLS, the attacker cannot trigger
  the buffer overflow without first successfully negotiating TLS.
