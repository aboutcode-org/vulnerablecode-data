severities: []
summary: An out-of-bounds heap buffer access flaw was found in the way the iSCSI Block
  driver in QEMU versions 2.12.0 before 4.2.1 handled a response coming from an iSCSI
  server while checking the status of a Logical Address Block (LBA) in an iscsi_co_block_status()
  routine. A remote user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process, resulting
  in a denial of service or potential execution of arbitrary code with privileges
  of the QEMU process on the host.
