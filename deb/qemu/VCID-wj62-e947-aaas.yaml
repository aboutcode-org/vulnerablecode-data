severities: []
summary: A potential DoS flaw was found in the virtio-fs shared file system daemon
  (virtiofsd) implementation of the QEMU version >= v5.0. Virtio-fs is meant to share
  a host file system directory with a guest via virtio-fs device. If the guest opens
  the maximum number of file descriptors under the shared directory, a denial of service
  may occur. This flaw allows a guest user/process to cause this denial of service
  on the host.
