summary: A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the NVM Express Controller (NVME) emulation
  in QEMU. This CVE is similar to CVE-2021-3750 and, just like it, when the reentrancy
  write triggers the reset function nvme_ctrl_reset(), data structs will be freed
  leading to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash
  the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition or, potentially,
  executing arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.
