severities: []
summary: VNC server implementation in Quick Emulator (QEMU) 2.11.0 and older was found
  to be vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation issue, as it did not throttle
  the framebuffer updates sent to its client. If the client did not consume these
  updates, VNC server allocates growing memory to hold onto this data. A malicious
  remote VNC client could use this flaw to cause DoS to the server host.
