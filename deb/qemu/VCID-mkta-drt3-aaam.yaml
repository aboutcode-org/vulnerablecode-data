severities: []
summary: An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the UAS (USB Attached SCSI) device
  emulation of QEMU in versions prior to 6.2.0-rc0. The device uses the guest supplied
  stream number unchecked, which can lead to out-of-bounds access to the UASDevice->data3
  and UASDevice->status3 fields. A malicious guest user could use this flaw to crash
  QEMU or potentially achieve code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process
  on the host.
