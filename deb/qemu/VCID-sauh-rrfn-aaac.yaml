severities: []
summary: A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in QEMU's Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA emulator's
  VNC display driver support before 2.9; the issue could occur when a VNC client attempted
  to update its display after a VGA operation is performed by a guest. A privileged
  user/process inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code on the host with privileges of the QEMU process.
