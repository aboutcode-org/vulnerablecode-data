severities: []
summary: A use-after-free flaw was found in the MegaRAID emulator of QEMU. This issue
  occurs while processing SCSI I/O requests in the case of an error mptsas_free_request()
  that does not dequeue the request object 'req' from a pending requests queue. This
  flaw allows a privileged guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting
  in a denial of service. Versions between 2.10.0 and 5.2.0 are potentially affected.
