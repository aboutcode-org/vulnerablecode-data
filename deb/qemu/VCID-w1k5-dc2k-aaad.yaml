summary: An out-of-bounds heap buffer access issue was found in the ARM Generic Interrupt
  Controller emulator of QEMU up to and including qemu 4.2.0on aarch64 platform. The
  issue occurs because while writing an interrupt ID to the controller memory area,
  it is not masked to be 4 bits wide. It may lead to the said issue while updating
  controller state fields and their subsequent processing. A privileged guest user
  may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.
