summary: The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective,
  thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues previously
  found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a malicious privileged
  guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or
  potential code execution. QEMU up to (including) 5.2.0 is affected by this.
