severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in the way qemu v1.3.0 and later (virtio-rng) validates
  addresses when guest accesses the config space of a virtio device. If the virtio
  device has zero/small sized config space, such as virtio-rng, a privileged guest
  user could use this flaw to access the matching host's qemu address space and thus
  increase their privileges on the host.
