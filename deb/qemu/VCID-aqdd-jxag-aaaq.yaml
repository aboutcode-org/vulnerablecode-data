severities: []
summary: A heap-based buffer overflow was found in QEMU through 5.0.0 in the SDHCI
  device emulation support. It could occur while doing a multi block SDMA transfer
  via the sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks() routine in hw/sd/sdhci.c. A guest user
  or process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting
  in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges
  of the QEMU process on the host.
