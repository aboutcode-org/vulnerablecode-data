summary: 'Heap-based buffer overflow in QEMU 0.8.2, as used in Xen and possibly other
  products, allows local users to execute arbitrary code via crafted data in the "net
  socket listen" option, aka QEMU "net socket" heap overflow.  NOTE: some sources
  have used CVE-2007-1321 to refer to this issue as part of "NE2000 network driver
  and the socket code," but this is the correct identifier for the individual net
  socket listen vulnerability.'
