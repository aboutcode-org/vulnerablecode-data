summary: The virtio_net_load function in hw/net/virtio-net.c in QEMU 1.5.0 through
  1.7.x before 1.7.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
  execute arbitrary code via vectors in which the value of curr_queues is greater
  than max_queues, which triggers an out-of-bounds write.
