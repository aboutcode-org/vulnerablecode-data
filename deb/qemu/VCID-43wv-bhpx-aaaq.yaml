severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in the virtio-fs shared file system daemon (virtiofsd) of
  QEMU. The new 'xattrmap' option may cause the 'security.capability' xattr in the
  guest to not drop on file write, potentially leading to a modified, privileged executable
  in the guest. In rare circumstances, this flaw could be used by a malicious user
  to elevate their privileges within the guest.
