severities: []
summary: QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) built with the Rocker switch emulation support
  is vulnerable to an off-by-one error. It happens while processing transmit (tx)
  descriptors in 'tx_consume' routine, if a descriptor was to have more than allowed
  (ROCKER_TX_FRAGS_MAX=16) fragments. A privileged user inside guest could use this
  flaw to cause memory leakage on the host or crash the QEMU process instance resulting
  in DoS issue.
