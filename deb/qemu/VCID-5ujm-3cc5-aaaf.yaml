summary: A flaw was found in the QEMU virtio-fs shared file system daemon (virtiofsd)
  implementation. This flaw is strictly related to CVE-2018-13405. A local guest user
  can create files in the directories shared by virtio-fs with unintended group ownership
  in a scenario where a directory is SGID to a certain group and is writable by a
  user who is not a member of the group. This could allow a malicious unprivileged
  user inside the guest to gain access to resources accessible to the root group,
  potentially escalating their privileges within the guest. A malicious local user
  in the host might also leverage this unexpected executable file created by the guest
  to escalate their privileges on the host system.
