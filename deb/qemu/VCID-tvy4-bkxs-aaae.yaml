severities: []
summary: A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the virtio-net device of QEMU.
  It could occur when the descriptor's address belongs to the non direct access region,
  due to num_buffers being set after the virtqueue elem has been unmapped. A malicious
  guest could use this flaw to crash QEMU, resulting in a denial of service condition,
  or potentially execute code on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
