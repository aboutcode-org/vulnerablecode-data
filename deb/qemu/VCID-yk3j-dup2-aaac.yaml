summary: A flaw was found in QEMU in the implementation of the Pointer Authentication
  (PAuth) support for ARM introduced in version 4.0 and fixed in version 5.0.0. A
  general failure of the signature generation process caused every PAuth-enforced
  pointer to be signed with the same signature. A local attacker could obtain the
  signature of a protected pointer and abuse this flaw to bypass PAuth protection
  for all programs running on QEMU.
