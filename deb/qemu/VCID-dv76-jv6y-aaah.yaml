severities: []
summary: QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) built with the e1000 NIC emulation support is vulnerable
  to an infinite loop issue. It could occur while processing data via transmit or
  receive descriptors, provided the initial receive/transmit descriptor head (TDH/RDH)
  is set outside the allocated descriptor buffer. A privileged user inside guest could
  use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance resulting in DoS.
