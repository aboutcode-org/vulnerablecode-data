summary: '** DISPUTED ** The disas_insn function in target/i386/translate.c in QEMU
  before 2.9.0, when TCG mode without hardware acceleration is used, does not limit
  the instruction size, which allows local users to gain privileges by creating a
  modified basic block that injects code into a setuid program, as demonstrated by
  procmail. NOTE: the vendor has stated "this bug does not violate any security guarantees
  QEMU makes."'
