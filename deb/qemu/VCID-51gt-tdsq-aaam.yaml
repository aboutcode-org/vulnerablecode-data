severities: []
summary: QEMU, through version 2.10 and through version 3.1.0, is vulnerable to an
  out-of-bounds read of up to 128 bytes in the hw/i2c/i2c-ddc.c:i2c_ddc() function.
  A local attacker with permission to execute i2c commands could exploit this to read
  stack memory of the qemu process on the host.
