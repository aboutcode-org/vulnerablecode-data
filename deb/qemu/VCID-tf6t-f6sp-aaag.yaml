summary: An assertion-failure flaw was found in Qemu before 2.10.1, in the Network
  Block Device (NBD) server's initial connection negotiation, where the I/O coroutine
  was undefined. This could crash the qemu-nbd server if a client sent unexpected
  data during connection negotiation. A remote user or process could use this flaw
  to crash the qemu-nbd server resulting in denial of service.
