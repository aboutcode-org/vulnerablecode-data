severities: []
summary: A heap buffer overflow was found in the floppy disk emulator of QEMU up to
  6.0.0 (including). It could occur in fdctrl_transfer_handler() in hw/block/fdc.c
  while processing DMA read data transfers from the floppy drive to the guest system.
  A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host
  resulting in DoS scenario, or potential information leakage from the host memory.
