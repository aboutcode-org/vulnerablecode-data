summary: QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) built with the TPR optimization for 32-bit Windows
  guests support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference flaw. It occurs while
  doing I/O port write operations via hmp interface. In that, 'current_cpu' remains
  null, which leads to the null pointer dereference. A user or process could use this
  flaw to crash the QEMU instance, resulting in DoS issue.
