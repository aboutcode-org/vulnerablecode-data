summary: hw/ide/core.c in QEMU does not properly restrict the commands accepted by
  an ATAPI device, which allows guest users to cause a denial of service or possibly
  have unspecified other impact via certain IDE commands, as demonstrated by a WIN_READ_NATIVE_MAX
  command to an empty drive, which triggers a divide-by-zero error and instance crash.
