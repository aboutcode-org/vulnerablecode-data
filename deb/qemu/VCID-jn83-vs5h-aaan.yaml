summary: A flaw was found in the QXL display device emulation in QEMU. A double fetch
  of guest controlled values `cursor->header.width` and `cursor->header.height` can
  lead to the allocation of a small cursor object followed by a subsequent heap-based
  buffer overflow. A malicious privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash
  the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context
  of the QEMU process.
