summary: A flaw was found in the QXL display device emulation in QEMU. An integer
  overflow in the cursor_alloc() function can lead to the allocation of a small cursor
  object followed by a subsequent heap-based buffer overflow. This flaw allows a malicious
  privileged guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute
  arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process.
