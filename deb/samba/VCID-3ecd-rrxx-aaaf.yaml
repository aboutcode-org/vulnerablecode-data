summary: Samba from version 4.7.0 has a vulnerability that allows a user in a Samba
  AD domain to crash the KDC when Samba is built in the non-default MIT Kerberos configuration.
  With this advisory the Samba Team clarify that the MIT Kerberos build of the Samba
  AD DC is considered experimental. Therefore the Samba Team will not issue security
  patches for this configuration. Additionally, Samba 4.7.12, 4.8.7 and 4.9.3 have
  been issued as security releases to prevent building of the AD DC with MIT Kerberos
  unless --with-experimental-mit-ad-dc is specified to the configure command.
