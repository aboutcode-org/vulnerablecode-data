summary: The Netlogon server implementation in smbd in Samba 3.5.x and 3.6.x before
  3.6.25, 4.0.x before 4.0.25, 4.1.x before 4.1.17, and 4.2.x before 4.2.0rc5 performs
  a free operation on an uninitialized stack pointer, which allows remote attackers
  to execute arbitrary code via crafted Netlogon packets that use the ServerPasswordSet
  RPC API, as demonstrated by packets reaching the _netr_ServerPasswordSet function
  in rpc_server/netlogon/srv_netlog_nt.c.
