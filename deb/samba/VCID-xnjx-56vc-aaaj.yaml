summary: All samba versions 4.9.x before 4.9.18, 4.10.x before 4.10.12 and 4.11.x
  before 4.11.5 have an issue where if it is set with "log level = 3" (or above) then
  the string obtained from the client, after a failed character conversion, is printed.
  Such strings can be provided during the NTLMSSP authentication exchange. In the
  Samba AD DC in particular, this may cause a long-lived process(such as the RPC server)
  to terminate. (In the file server case, the most likely target, smbd, operates as
  process-per-client and so a crash there is harmless).
