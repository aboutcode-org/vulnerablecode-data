summary: The NTLMSSP authentication implementation in Samba 3.x and 4.x before 4.2.11,
  4.3.x before 4.3.8, and 4.4.x before 4.4.2 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
  perform protocol-downgrade attacks by modifying the client-server data stream to
  remove application-layer flags or encryption settings, as demonstrated by clearing
  the NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE_SEAL or NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE_SIGN option to disrupt LDAP security.
