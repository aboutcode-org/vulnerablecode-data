severities: []
summary: The Samba vfs_fruit module uses extended file attributes (EA, xattr) to provide
  "...enhanced compatibility with Apple SMB clients and interoperability with a Netatalk
  3 AFP fileserver." Samba versions prior to 4.13.17, 4.14.12 and 4.15.5 with vfs_fruit
  configured allow out-of-bounds heap read and write via specially crafted extended
  file attributes. A remote attacker with write access to extended file attributes
  can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of smbd, typically root.
