summary: A flaw was found in samba versions 4.0.0 to 4.5.2. The Samba routine ndr_pull_dnsp_name
  contains an integer wrap problem, leading to an attacker-controlled memory overwrite.
  ndr_pull_dnsp_name parses data from the Samba Active Directory ldb database. Any
  user who can write to the dnsRecord attribute over LDAP can trigger this memory
  corruption. By default, all authenticated LDAP users can write to the dnsRecord
  attribute on new DNS objects. This makes the defect a remote privilege escalation.
