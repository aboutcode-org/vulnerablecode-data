summary: The owner_set function in smbcacls.c in smbcacls in Samba 4.0.x before 4.0.16
  and 4.1.x before 4.1.6 removes an ACL during use of a --chown or --chgrp option,
  which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic
  circumstances by leveraging an unintended administrative change.
