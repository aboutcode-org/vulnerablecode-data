summary: The samldb_check_user_account_control_acl function in dsdb/samdb/ldb_modules/samldb.c
  in Samba 4.x before 4.1.22, 4.2.x before 4.2.7, and 4.3.x before 4.3.3 does not
  properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts,
  which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by
  leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar
  issue to CVE-2015-2535.
