summary: The bundled LDAP client library in Samba 3.x and 4.x before 4.2.11, 4.3.x
  before 4.3.8, and 4.4.x before 4.4.2 does not recognize the "client ldap sasl wrapping"
  setting, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to perform LDAP protocol-downgrade
  attacks by modifying the client-server data stream.
