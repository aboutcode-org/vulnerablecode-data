summary: Samba from version 4.3.0 and before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7 and 4.9.3 are
  vulnerable to a denial of service. When configured to accept smart-card authentication,
  Samba's KDC will call talloc_free() twice on the same memory if the principal in
  a validly signed certificate does not match the principal in the AS-REQ. This is
  only possible after authentication with a trusted certificate. talloc is robust
  against further corruption from a double-free with talloc_free() and directly calls
  abort(), terminating the KDC process.
