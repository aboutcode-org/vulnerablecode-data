summary: All Samba versions 4.x.x before 4.9.17, 4.10.x before 4.10.11 and 4.11.x
  before 4.11.3 have an issue, where the (poorly named) dnsserver RPC pipe provides
  administrative facilities to modify DNS records and zones. Samba, when acting as
  an AD DC, stores DNS records in LDAP. In AD, the default permissions on the DNS
  partition allow creation of new records by authenticated users. This is used for
  example to allow machines to self-register in DNS. If a DNS record was created that
  case-insensitively matched the name of the zone, the ldb_qsort() and dns_name_compare()
  routines could be confused into reading memory prior to the list of DNS entries
  when responding to DnssrvEnumRecords() or DnssrvEnumRecords2() and so following
  invalid memory as a pointer.
