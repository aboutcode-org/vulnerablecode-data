severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in samba. The Samba smbd file server must map Windows group
  identities (SIDs) into unix group ids (gids). The code that performs this had a
  flaw that could allow it to read data beyond the end of the array in the case where
  a negative cache entry had been added to the mapping cache. This could cause the
  calling code to return those values into the process token that stores the group
  membership for a user. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality
  and integrity.
