summary: A flaw was found in Samba, all versions starting samba 4.5.0 before samba
  4.9.15, samba 4.10.10, samba 4.11.2, in the way it handles a user password change
  or a new password for a samba user. The Samba Active Directory Domain Controller
  can be configured to use a custom script to check for password complexity. This
  configuration can fail to verify password complexity when non-ASCII characters are
  used in the password, which could lead to weak passwords being set for samba users,
  making it vulnerable to dictionary attacks.
