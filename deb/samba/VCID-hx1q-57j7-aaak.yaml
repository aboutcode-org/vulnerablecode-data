summary: The SMB2 implementation in Samba 3.6.x before 3.6.6, as used on the IBM Storwize
  V7000 Unified 1.3 before 1.3.2.3 and 1.4 before 1.4.0.1 and possibly other products,
  does not properly enforce CIFS share attributes, which allows remote authenticated
  users to (1) write to a read-only share; (2) trigger data-integrity problems related
  to the oplock, locking, coherency, or leases attribute; or (3) have an unspecified
  impact by leveraging incorrect handling of the browseable or "hide unreadable" parameter.
