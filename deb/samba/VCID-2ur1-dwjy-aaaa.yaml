severities: []
summary: Samba 4.0.x before 4.0.1, in certain Active Directory domain-controller configurations,
  does not properly interpret Access Control Entries that are based on an objectClass,
  which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended restrictions on modifying
  LDAP directory objects by leveraging (1) objectClass access by a user, (2) objectClass
  access by a group, or (3) write access to an attribute.
