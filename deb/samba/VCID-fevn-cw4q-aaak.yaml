summary: Samba from version 4.0.0 and before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7, 4.9.3 is vulnerable
  to a denial of service. During the processing of an LDAP search before Samba's AD
  DC returns the LDAP entries to the client, the entries are cached in a single memory
  object with a maximum size of 256MB. When this size is reached, the Samba process
  providing the LDAP service will follow the NULL pointer, terminating the process.
  There is no further vulnerability associated with this issue, merely a denial of
  service.
