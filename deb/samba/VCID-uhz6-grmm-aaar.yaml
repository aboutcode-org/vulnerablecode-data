summary: In DCE/RPC it is possible to share the handles (cookies for resource state)
  between multiple connections via a mechanism called 'association groups'. These
  handles can reference connections to our sam.ldb database. However while the database
  was correctly shared, the user credentials state was only pointed at, and when one
  connection within that association group ended, the database would be left pointing
  at an invalid 'struct session_info'. The most likely outcome here is a crash, but
  it is possible that the use-after-free could instead allow different user state
  to be pointed at and this might allow more privileged access.
