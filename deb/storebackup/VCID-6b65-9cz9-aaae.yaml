severities: []
summary: storeBackup.pl in storeBackup through 3.5 relies on the /tmp/storeBackup.lock
  pathname, which allows symlink attacks that possibly lead to privilege escalation.
  (Local users can also create a plain file named /tmp/storeBackup.lock to block use
  of storeBackup until an admin manually deletes that file.)
