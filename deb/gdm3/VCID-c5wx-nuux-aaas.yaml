summary: A flaw was found in GDM in versions prior to 3.38.2.1. A race condition in
  the handling of session shutdown makes it possible to bypass the lock screen for
  a user that has autologin enabled, accessing their session without authentication.
  This is similar to CVE-2017-12164, but requires more difficult conditions to exploit.
