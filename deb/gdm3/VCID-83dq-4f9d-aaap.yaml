summary: The daemon in GDM through 3.29.1 does not properly unexport display objects
  from its D-Bus interface when they are destroyed, which allows a local attacker
  to trigger a use-after-free via a specially crafted sequence of D-Bus method calls,
  resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution.
