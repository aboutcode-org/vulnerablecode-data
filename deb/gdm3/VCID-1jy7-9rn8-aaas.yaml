severities: []
summary: gdm3 versions before 3.36.2 or 3.38.2 would start gnome-initial-setup if
  gdm3 can't contact the accountservice service via dbus in a timely manner; on Ubuntu
  (and potentially derivatives) this could be be chained with an additional issue
  that could allow a local user to create a new privileged account.
