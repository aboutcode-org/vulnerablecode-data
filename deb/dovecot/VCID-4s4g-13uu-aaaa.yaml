severities: []
summary: Dovecot before version 2.2.29 is vulnerable to a denial of service. When
  'dict' passdb and userdb were used for user authentication, the username sent by
  the IMAP/POP3 client was sent through var_expand() to perform %variable expansion.
  Sending specially crafted %variable fields could result in excessive memory usage
  causing the process to crash (and restart), or excessive CPU usage causing all authentications
  to hang.
