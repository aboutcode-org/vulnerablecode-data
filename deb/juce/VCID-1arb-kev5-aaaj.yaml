summary: This affects the package juce-framework/JUCE before 6.1.5. This vulnerability
  is triggered when a malicious archive is crafted with an entry containing a symbolic
  link. When extracted, the symbolic link is followed outside of the target dir allowing
  writing arbitrary files on the target host. In some cases, this can allow an attacker
  to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerable code is in the ZipFile::uncompressEntry
  function in juce_ZipFile.cpp and is executed when the archive is extracted upon
  calling uncompressTo() on a ZipFile object.
