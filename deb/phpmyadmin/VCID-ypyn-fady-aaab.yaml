summary: An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. When the user does not specify a blowfish_secret
  key for encrypting cookies, phpMyAdmin generates one at runtime. A vulnerability
  was reported where the way this value is created uses a weak algorithm. This could
  allow an attacker to determine the user's blowfish_secret and potentially decrypt
  their cookies. All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.5), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.9),
  and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.18) are affected.
