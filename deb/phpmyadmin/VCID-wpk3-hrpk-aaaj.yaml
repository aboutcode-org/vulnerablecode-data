severities: []
summary: 'The PMA_ArrayWalkRecursive function in libraries/common.lib.php in phpMyAdmin
  before 2.10.0.2 does not limit recursion on arrays provided by users, which allows
  context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (web server crash) via
  an array with many dimensions.  NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability
  is caused by a problem in PHP (CVE-2006-1549) and the proper fix should be in PHP;
  if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin.'
