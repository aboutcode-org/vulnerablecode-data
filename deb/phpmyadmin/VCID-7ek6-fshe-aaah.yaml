  of phpMyAdmin in an unexpected way, it is possible to trigger phpMyAdmin to display
  a PHP error message which contains the full path of the directory where phpMyAdmin
  is installed. During an execution timeout in the export functionality, the errors
  containing the full path of the directory of phpMyAdmin are written to the export
  file. All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.5), and 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.9)
  are affected. This CVE is for the curl wrapper issue.
