summary: An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. Some data is passed to the PHP unserialize()
  function without verification that it's valid serialized data. The unserialization
  can result in code execution because of the interaction with object instantiation
  and autoloading. All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.4), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.8),
  and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.17) are affected.
