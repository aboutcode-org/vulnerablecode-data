summary: phpMyAdmin 3.5.x before 3.5.8 and 4.x before 4.0.0-rc3, when a SaveDir directory
  is configured, allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by using
  a double extension in the filename of an export file, leading to interpretation
  of this file as an executable file by the Apache HTTP Server, as demonstrated by
  a .php.sql filename.
