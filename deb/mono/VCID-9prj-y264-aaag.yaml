summary: Race condition in the FastCopy optimization in the Array.Copy method in metadata/icall.c
  in Mono, when Moonlight 2.x before 2.4.1 or 3.x before 3.99.3 is used, allows remote
  attackers to trigger a buffer overflow and modify internal data structures, and
  cause a denial of service (plugin crash) or corrupt the internal state of the security
  manager, via a crafted media file in which a thread makes a change after a type
  check but before a copy action.
