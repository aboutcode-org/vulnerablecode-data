summary: The RuntimeHelpers.InitializeArray method in metadata/icall.c in Mono, when
  Moonlight 2.x before 2.4.1 or 3.x before 3.99.3 is used, does not properly restrict
  data types, which allows remote attackers to modify internal read-only data structures,
  and cause a denial of service (plugin crash) or corrupt the internal state of the
  security manager, via a crafted media file, as demonstrated by modifying a C# struct.
