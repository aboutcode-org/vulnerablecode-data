summary: 'SharpZipLib (or #ziplib) is a Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library. Starting
  version 1.3.0 and prior to version 1.3.3, a check was added if the destination file
  is under destination directory. However, it is not enforced that `destDir` ends
  with slash. If the `destDir` is not slash terminated like `/home/user/dir` it is
  possible to create a file with a name thats begins with the destination directory,
  i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`. Because of the file name and destination directory constraints,
  the arbitrary file creation impact is limited and depends on the use case. Version
  1.3.3 contains a patch for this vulnerability.'
