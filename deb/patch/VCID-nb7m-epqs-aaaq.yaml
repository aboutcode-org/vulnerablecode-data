summary: GNU Patch version 2.7.6 contains an input validation vulnerability when processing
  patch files, specifically the EDITOR_PROGRAM invocation (using ed) can result in
  code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via a patch file processed
  via the patch utility. This is similar to FreeBSD's CVE-2015-1418 however although
  they share a common ancestry the code bases have diverged over time.
