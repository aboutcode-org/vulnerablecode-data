severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD through 1.3.6b. Failure
  to check for the appropriate field of a CRL entry (checking twice for subject, rather
  than once for subject and once for issuer) prevents some valid CRLs from being taken
  into account, and can allow clients whose certificates have been revoked to proceed
  with a connection to the server.
