severities: []
summary: ProFTPD before 1.3.5e and 1.3.6 before 1.3.6rc5 controls whether the home
  directory of a user could contain a symbolic link through the AllowChrootSymlinks
  configuration option, but checks only the last path component when enforcing AllowChrootSymlinks.
  Attackers with local access could bypass the AllowChrootSymlinks control by replacing
  a path component (other than the last one) with a symbolic link. The threat model
  includes an attacker who is not granted full filesystem access by a hosting provider,
  but can reconfigure the home directory of an FTP user.
