summary: '** DISPUTED **  ProFTPD 1.3.0a and earlier does not properly set the buffer
  size limit when CommandBufferSize is specified in the configuration file, which
  leads to an off-by-two buffer underflow.  NOTE: in November 2006, the role of CommandBufferSize
  was originally associated with CVE-2006-5815, but this was an error stemming from
  a vague initial disclosure.  NOTE: ProFTPD developers dispute this issue, saying
  that the relevant memory location is overwritten by assignment before further use
  within the affected function, so this is not a vulnerability.'
