summary: mate-screensaver before 1.20.2 in MATE Desktop Environment allows physically
  proximate attackers to view screen content and possibly control applications. By
  unplugging and re-plugging or power-cycling external output devices (such as additionally
  attached graphical outputs via HDMI, VGA, DVI, etc.) the content of a screensaver-locked
  session can be revealed. In some scenarios, the attacker can execute applications,
  such as by clicking with a mouse.
