severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Dropbear through 2020.81. Due to a non-RFC-compliant
  check of the available authentication methods in the client-side SSH code, it is
  possible for an SSH server to change the login process in its favor. This attack
  can bypass additional security measures such as FIDO2 tokens or SSH-Askpass. Thus,
  it allows an attacker to abuse a forwarded agent for logging on to another server
  unnoticed.
