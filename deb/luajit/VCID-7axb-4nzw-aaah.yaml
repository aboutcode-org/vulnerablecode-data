summary: '** DISPUTED ** In LuaJIT through 2.0.5, as used in Moonjit before 2.1.2
  and other products, debug.getinfo has a type confusion issue that leads to arbitrary
  memory write or read operations, because certain cases involving valid stack levels
  and > options are mishandled. NOTE: The LuaJIT project owner states that the debug
  libary is unsafe by definition and that this is not a vulnerability. When LuaJIT
  was originally developed, the expectation was that the entire debug library had
  no security guarantees and thus it made no sense to assign CVEs. However, not all
  users of later LuaJIT derivatives share this perspective.'
