severities: []
summary: In OpenStack os-vif 1.15.x before 1.15.2, and 1.16.0, a hard-coded MAC aging
  time of 0 disables MAC learning in linuxbridge, forcing obligatory Ethernet flooding
  of non-local destinations, which both impedes network performance and allows users
  to possibly view the content of packets for instances belonging to other tenants
  sharing the same network. Only deployments using the linuxbridge backend are affected.
  This occurs in PyRoute2.add() in internal/command/ip/linux/impl_pyroute2.py.
