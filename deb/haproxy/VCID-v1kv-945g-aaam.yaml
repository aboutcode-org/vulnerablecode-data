summary: An issue was discovered in HAProxy before 1.8.8. The incoming H2 frame length
  was checked against the max_frame_size setting instead of being checked against
  the bufsize. The max_frame_size only applies to outgoing traffic and not to incoming,
  so if a large enough frame size is advertised in the SETTINGS frame, a wrapped frame
  will be defragmented into a temporary allocated buffer where the second fragment
  may overflow the heap by up to 16 kB. It is very unlikely that this can be exploited
  for code execution given that buffers are very short lived and their addresses not
  realistically predictable in production, but the likelihood of an immediate crash
  is absolutely certain.
