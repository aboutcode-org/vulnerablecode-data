severities: []
summary: Buffer overflow in HAProxy 1.4 through 1.4.22 and 1.5-dev through 1.5-dev17,
  when HTTP keep-alive is enabled, using HTTP keywords in TCP inspection rules, and
  running with rewrite rules that appends to requests, allows remote attackers to
  cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted
  pipelined HTTP requests that prevent request realignment from occurring.
