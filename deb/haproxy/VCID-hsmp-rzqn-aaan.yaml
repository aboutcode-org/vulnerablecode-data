summary: A flaw was found in HAProxy before 2.0.6. In legacy mode, messages featuring
  a transfer-encoding header missing the "chunked" value were not being correctly
  rejected. The impact was limited but if combined with the "http-reuse always" setting,
  it could be used to help construct an HTTP request smuggling attack against a vulnerable
  component employing a lenient parser that would ignore the content-length header
  as soon as it saw a transfer-encoding one (even if not entirely valid according
  to the specification).
