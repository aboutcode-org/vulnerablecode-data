severities: []
summary: An out-of-bounds read in dns_validate_dns_response in dns.c was discovered
  in HAProxy through 1.8.14. Due to a missing check when validating DNS responses,
  remote attackers might be able read the 16 bytes corresponding to an AAAA record
  from the non-initialized part of the buffer, possibly accessing anything that was
  left on the stack, or even past the end of the 8193-byte buffer, depending on the
  value of accepted_payload_size.
