severities: []
summary: A directory traversal issue was found in reposync, a part of yum-utils, where
  reposync fails to sanitize paths in remote repository configuration files. If an
  attacker controls a repository, they may be able to copy files outside of the destination
  directory on the targeted system via path traversal. If reposync is running with
  heightened privileges on a targeted system, this flaw could potentially result in
  system compromise via the overwriting of critical system files. Version 1.1.31 and
  older are believed to be affected.
