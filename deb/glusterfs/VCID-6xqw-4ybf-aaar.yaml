severities: []
summary: It was found that glusterfs server is vulnerable to multiple stack based
  buffer overflows due to functions in server-rpc-fopc.c allocating fixed size buffers
  using 'alloca(3)'. An authenticated attacker could exploit this by mounting a gluster
  volume and sending a string longer that the fixed buffer size to cause crash or
  potential code execution.
