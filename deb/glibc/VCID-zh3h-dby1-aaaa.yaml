summary: A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc upstream version 2.14
  was found in the way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
  an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this issue. A local
  attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted path that, when
  processed by the glob function, would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
  This was fixed in version 2.32.
