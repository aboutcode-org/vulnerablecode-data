summary: Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the (1) send_dg and (2) send_vc
  functions in the libresolv library in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before
  2.23 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute
  arbitrary code via a crafted DNS response that triggers a call to the getaddrinfo
  function with the AF_UNSPEC or AF_INET6 address family, related to performing "dual
  A/AAAA DNS queries" and the libnss_dns.so.2 NSS module.
