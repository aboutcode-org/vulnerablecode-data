severities: []
summary: 'elf/dl-load.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.19 through 2.26
  mishandles RPATH and RUNPATH containing $ORIGIN for a privileged (setuid or AT_SECURE)
  program, which allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse library
  in the current working directory, related to the fillin_rpath and decompose_rpath
  functions. This is associated with misinterpretion of an empty RPATH/RUNPATH token
  as the "./" directory. NOTE: this configuration of RPATH/RUNPATH for a privileged
  program is apparently very uncommon; most likely, no such program is shipped with
  any common Linux distribution.'
