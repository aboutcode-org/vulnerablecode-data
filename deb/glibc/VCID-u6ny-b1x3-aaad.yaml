severities: []
summary: An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy()
  implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize
  the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num' parameter results
  in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter
  to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing
  to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this
  memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where
  a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
  execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.
