summary: The malloc implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6), from
  version 2.24 to 2.26 on powerpc, and only in version 2.26 on i386, did not properly
  handle malloc calls with arguments close to SIZE_MAX and could return a pointer
  to a heap region that is smaller than requested, eventually leading to heap corruption.
