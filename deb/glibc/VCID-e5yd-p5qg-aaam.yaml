summary: A flaw was found in glibc. An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in
  getcwd() may lead to memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1.
  A local attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd() in
  a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate
  their privileges on the system.
