summary: The malloc function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.26 could
  return a memory block that is too small if an attempt is made to allocate an object
  whose size is close to SIZE_MAX, potentially leading to a subsequent heap overflow.
  This occurs because the per-thread cache (aka tcache) feature enables a code path
  that lacks an integer overflow check.
