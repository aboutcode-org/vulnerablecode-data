severities: []
summary: In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.28, the getaddrinfo function
  would successfully parse a string that contained an IPv4 address followed by whitespace
  and arbitrary characters, which could lead applications to incorrectly assume that
  it had parsed a valid string, without the possibility of embedded HTTP headers or
  other potentially dangerous substrings.
