summary: glibc contains a vulnerability that allows specially crafted LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  values to manipulate the heap/stack, causing them to alias, potentially resulting
  in arbitrary code execution. Please note that additional hardening changes have
  been made to glibc to prevent manipulation of stack and heap memory but these issues
  are not directly exploitable, as such they have not been given a CVE. This affects
  glibc 2.25 and earlier.
