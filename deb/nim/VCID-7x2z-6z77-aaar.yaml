severities: []
summary: Nimble is a package manager for the Nim programming language. In Nim release
  versions before versions 1.2.10 and 1.4.4, "nimble refresh" fetches a list of Nimble
  packages over HTTPS by default. In case of error it falls back to a non-TLS URL
  http://irclogs.nim-lang.org/packages.json. An attacker able to perform MitM can
  deliver a modified package list containing malicious software packages. If the packages
  are installed and used the attack escalates to untrusted code execution.
