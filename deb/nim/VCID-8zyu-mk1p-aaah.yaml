summary: 'An issue was discovered in Nim before 1.6.2. The RST module of the Nim language
  stdlib, as used in NimForum and other products, permits the javascript: URI scheme
  and thus can lead to XSS in some applications. (Nim versions 1.6.2 and later are
  fixed; there may be backports of the fix to some earlier versions. NimForum 2.2.0
  is fixed.)'
