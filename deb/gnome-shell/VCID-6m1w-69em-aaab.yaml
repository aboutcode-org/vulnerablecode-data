summary: GNOME Shell 3.14.x before 3.14.1, when the Screen Lock feature is used, does
  not limit the aggregate memory consumption of all active PrtSc requests, which allows
  physically proximate attackers to execute arbitrary commands on an unattended workstation
  by making many PrtSc requests and leveraging a temporary lock outage, and the resulting
  temporary shell availability, caused by the Linux kernel OOM killer.
