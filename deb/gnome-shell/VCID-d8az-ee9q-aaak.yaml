summary: Linux distributions using CAP_SYS_NICE for gnome-shell may be exposed to
  a privilege escalation issue. An attacker, with low privilege permissions, may take
  advantage of the way CAP_SYS_NICE is currently implemented and eventually load code
  to increase its process scheduler priority leading to possible DoS of other services
  running in the same machine.
