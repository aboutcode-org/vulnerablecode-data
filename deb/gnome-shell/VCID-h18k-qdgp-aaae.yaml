summary: A locking protection bypass flaw was found in some versions of gnome-shell
  as shipped within CentOS Stream 8, when the "Application menu" or "Window list"
  GNOME extensions are enabled. This flaw allows a physical attacker who has access
  to a locked system to kill existing applications and start new ones as the locked
  user, even if the session is still locked.
