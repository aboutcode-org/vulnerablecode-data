severities: []
summary: It was found that cifs-utils' mount.cifs was invoking a shell when requesting
  the Samba password, which could be used to inject arbitrary commands. An attacker
  able to invoke mount.cifs with special permission, such as via sudo rules, could
  use this flaw to escalate their privileges.
