severities: []
summary: An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP networking
  implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the udp_input() function and could occur
  while processing a udp packet that is smaller than the size of the 'udphdr' structure.
  This issue may lead to out-of-bounds read access or indirect host memory disclosure
  to the guest. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.
  This flaw affects libslirp versions prior to 4.6.0.
