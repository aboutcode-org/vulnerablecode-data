severities: []
summary: An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP networking
  implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the bootp_input() function and could
  occur while processing a udp packet that is smaller than the size of the 'bootp_t'
  structure. A malicious guest could use this flaw to leak 10 bytes of uninitialized
  heap memory from the host. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
  confidentiality. This flaw affects libslirp versions prior to 4.6.0.
