severities: []
summary: The mkdir procedure of GNU Guile temporarily changed the process' umask to
  zero. During that time window, in a multithreaded application, other threads could
  end up creating files with insecure permissions. For example, mkdir without the
  optional mode argument would create directories as 0777. This is fixed in Guile
  2.0.13. Prior versions are affected.
