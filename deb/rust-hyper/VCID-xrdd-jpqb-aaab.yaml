summary: 'hyper is an HTTP library for rust. hyper''s HTTP/1 server code had a flaw
  that incorrectly parses and accepts requests with a `Content-Length` header with
  a prefixed plus sign, when it should have been rejected as illegal. This combined
  with an upstream HTTP proxy that doesn''t parse such `Content-Length` headers, but
  forwards them, can result in "request smuggling" or "desync attacks". The flaw exists
  in all prior versions of hyper prior to 0.14.10, if built with `rustc` v1.5.0 or
  newer. The vulnerability is patched in hyper version 0.14.10. Two workarounds exist:
  One may reject requests manually that contain a plus sign prefix in the `Content-Length`
  header or ensure any upstream proxy handles `Content-Length` headers with a plus
  sign prefix.'
