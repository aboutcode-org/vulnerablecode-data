severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in openstack-mistral. By manipulating the SSH private key
  filename, the std.ssh action can be used to disclose the presence of arbitrary files
  within the filesystem of the executor running the action. Since std.ssh private_key_filename
  can take an absolute path, it can be used to assess whether or not a file exists
  on the executor's filesystem.
