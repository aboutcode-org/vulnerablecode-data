summary: This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information
  on vulnerable installations of PoDoFo. User interaction is required to exploit this
  vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious
  file. The specific flaw exists within PdfEncoding::ParseToUnicode. The issue results
  from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a
  memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other
  vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
