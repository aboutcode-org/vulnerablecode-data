summary: An Ubuntu-specific patch in PulseAudio created a race condition where the
  snap policy module would fail to identify a client connection from a snap as coming
  from a snap if SCM_CREDENTIALS were missing, allowing the snap to connect to PulseAudio
  without proper confinement. This could be exploited by an attacker to expose sensitive
  information. Fixed in 1:13.99.3-1ubuntu2, 1:13.99.2-1ubuntu2.1, 1:13.99.1-1ubuntu3.8,
  1:11.1-1ubuntu7.11, and 1:8.0-0ubuntu3.15.
