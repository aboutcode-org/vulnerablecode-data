summary: The iseries_check_file_type function in wiretap/iseries.c in the iSeries
  file parser in Wireshark 2.0.x before 2.0.2 does not consider that a line may lack
  the "OBJECT PROTOCOL" substring, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted file.
