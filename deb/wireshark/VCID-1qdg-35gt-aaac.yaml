summary: The logcat_dump_text function in wiretap/logcat.c in the Android Logcat file
  parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.5 does not properly handle a lack of \0 termination,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and
  application crash) via a crafted message in a packet, a different vulnerability
  than CVE-2015-3815.
