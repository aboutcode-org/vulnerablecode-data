summary: The fragment_add_work function in epan/reassemble.c in the packet-reassembly
  feature in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.5 does not properly determine the defragmentation
  state in a case of an insufficient snapshot length, which allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted packet.
