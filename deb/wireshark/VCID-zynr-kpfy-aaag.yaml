severities: []
summary: In Wireshark 2.2.4 and earlier, a crafted or malformed STANAG 4607 capture
  file will cause an infinite loop and memory exhaustion. If the packet size field
  in a packet header is null, the offset to read from will not advance, causing continuous
  attempts to read the same zero length packet. This will quickly exhaust all system
  memory.
