summary: The detect_version function in wiretap/logcat.c in the Android Logcat file
  parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.5 does not check the length of the payload,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and
  application crash) via a packet with a crafted payload, as demonstrated by a length
  of zero, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-3906.
