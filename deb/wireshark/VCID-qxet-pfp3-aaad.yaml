summary: The dissect_server_info function in epan/dissectors/packet-ms-mms.c in the
  MS-MMS dissector in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.14 and 1.8.x before 1.8.6 does not
  properly manage string lengths, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (application crash) via a malformed packet that (1) triggers an integer
  overflow or (2) has embedded '\0' characters in a string.
