summary: The ngsniffer_process_record function in wiretap/ngsniffer.c in the Sniffer
  file parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not validate
  the relationships between record lengths and record header lengths, which allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application
  crash) via a crafted file.
