summary: The dissect_frame function in epan/dissectors/packet-frame.c in the frame
  metadissector in Wireshark 1.10.x before 1.10.8 interprets a negative integer as
  a length value even though it was intended to represent an error condition, which
  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted
  packet.
