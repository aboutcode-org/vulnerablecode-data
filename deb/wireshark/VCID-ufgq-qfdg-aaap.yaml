summary: The dissect_dvbci_tpdu_hdr function in epan/dissectors/packet-dvbci.c in
  the DVB-CI dissector in Wireshark 1.8.x before 1.8.9 and 1.10.x before 1.10.1 does
  not validate a certain length value before decrementing it, which allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and application exit)
  via a crafted packet.
