summary: 'In Wireshark through 2.0.13 and 2.2.x through 2.2.7, the WBXML dissector
  could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture
  file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-wbxml.c by adding validation
  of the relationships between indexes and lengths. NOTE: this vulnerability exists
  because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-7702.'
