severities: []
summary: The File_read_line function in epan/wslua/wslua_file.c in Wireshark through
  2.2.11 does not properly strip '\n' characters, which allows remote attackers to
  cause a denial of service (buffer underflow and application crash) via a crafted
  packet that triggers the attempted processing of an empty line.
