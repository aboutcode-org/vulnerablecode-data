summary: The _prolog_error function in slurmd/req.c in Slurm before 15.08.13, 16.x
  before 16.05.7, and 17.x before 17.02.0-pre4 has a vulnerability in how the slurmd
  daemon informs users of a Prolog failure on a compute node. That vulnerability could
  allow a user to assume control of an arbitrary file on the system. Any exploitation
  of this is dependent on the user being able to cause or anticipate the failure (non-zero
  return code) of a Prolog script that their job would run on. This issue affects
  all Slurm versions from 0.6.0 (September 2005) to present. Workarounds to prevent
  exploitation of this are to either disable your Prolog script, or modify it such
  that it always returns 0 ("success") and adjust it to set the node as down using
  scontrol instead of relying on the slurmd to handle that automatically. If you do
  not have a Prolog set you are unaffected by this issue.
