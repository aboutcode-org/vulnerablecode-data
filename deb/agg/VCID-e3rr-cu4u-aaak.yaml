severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG) 2.4 as used in SVG++
  (aka svgpp) 1.2.3. In the function agg::cell_aa::not_equal, dx is assigned to (x2
  - x1). If dx >= dx_limit, which is (16384 << poly_subpixel_shift), this function
  will call itself recursively. There can be a situation where (x2 - x1) is always
  bigger than dx_limit during the recursion, leading to continual stack consumption.
