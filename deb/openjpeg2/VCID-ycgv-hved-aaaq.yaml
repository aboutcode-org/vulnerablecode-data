summary: A buffer overflow in OpenJPEG 2.1.1 causes arbitrary code execution when
  parsing a crafted image. An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the
  jpeg2000 image file format parser as implemented in the OpenJpeg library. A specially
  crafted jpeg2000 file can cause an out of bound heap write resulting in heap corruption
  leading to arbitrary code execution. For a successful attack, the target user needs
  to open a malicious jpeg2000 file. The jpeg2000 image file format is mostly used
  for embedding images inside PDF documents and the OpenJpeg library is used by a
  number of popular PDF renderers making PDF documents a likely attack vector.
