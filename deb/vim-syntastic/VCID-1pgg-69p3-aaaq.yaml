severities: []
summary: 'Syntastic (aka vim-syntastic) through 3.9.0 does not properly handle searches
  for configuration files (it searches the current directory up to potentially the
  root). This improper handling might be exploited for arbitrary code execution via
  a malicious gcc plugin, if an attacker has write access to a directory that is a
  parent of the base directory of the project being checked. NOTE: exploitation is
  more difficult after 3.8.0 because filename prediction may be needed.'
