severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in the hivex library in versions before 1.3.20. It is caused
  due to a lack of bounds check within the hivex_open function. An attacker could
  input a specially crafted Windows Registry (hive) file which would cause hivex to
  read memory beyond its normal bounds or cause the program to crash. The highest
  threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
