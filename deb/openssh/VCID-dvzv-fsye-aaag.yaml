severities: []
summary: The client in OpenSSH before 7.2 mishandles failed cookie generation for
  untrusted X11 forwarding and relies on the local X11 server for access-control decisions,
  which allows remote X11 clients to trigger a fallback and obtain trusted X11 forwarding
  privileges by leveraging configuration issues on this X11 server, as demonstrated
  by lack of the SECURITY extension on this X11 server.
