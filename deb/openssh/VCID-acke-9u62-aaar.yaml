summary: 'OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an experimental
  key type, has a pre-authentication integer overflow if a client or server is configured
  to use a crafted XMSS key. This leads to memory corruption and local code execution
  because of an error in the XMSS key parsing algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation
  is considered experimental in all released OpenSSH versions, and there is no supported
  way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.'
