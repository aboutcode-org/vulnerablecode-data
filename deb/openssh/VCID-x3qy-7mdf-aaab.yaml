severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being
  derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the
  client. However, the scp client only performs cursory validation of the object name
  returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious scp server
  (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client
  target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate
  subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).
