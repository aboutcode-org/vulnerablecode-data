severities: []
summary: The kbdint_next_device function in auth2-chall.c in sshd in OpenSSH through
  6.9 does not properly restrict the processing of keyboard-interactive devices within
  a single connection, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force
  attacks or cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a long and duplicative
  list in the ssh -oKbdInteractiveDevices option, as demonstrated by a modified client
  that provides a different password for each pam element on this list.
