severities: []
summary: The shared memory manager (associated with pre-authentication compression)
  in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4 does not ensure that a bounds check is enforced by
  all compilers, which might allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging access
  to a sandboxed privilege-separation process, related to the m_zback and m_zlib data
  structures.
