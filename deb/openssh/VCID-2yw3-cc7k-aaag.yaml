summary: '** DISPUTED ** The scp client in OpenSSH 8.2 incorrectly sends duplicate
  responses to the server upon a utimes system call failure, which allows a malicious
  unprivileged user on the remote server to overwrite arbitrary files in the client''s
  download directory by creating a crafted subdirectory anywhere on the remote server.
  The victim must use the command scp -rp to download a file hierarchy containing,
  anywhere inside, this crafted subdirectory. NOTE: the vendor points out that "this
  attack can achieve no more than a hostile peer is already able to achieve within
  the scp protocol" and "utimes does not fail under normal circumstances."'
