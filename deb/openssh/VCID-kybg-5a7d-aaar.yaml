summary: The OpenSSH server, as used in Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and
  when running in a Kerberos environment, allows remote authenticated users to log
  in as another user when they are listed in the .k5users file of that user, which
  might bypass intended authentication requirements that would force a local login.
