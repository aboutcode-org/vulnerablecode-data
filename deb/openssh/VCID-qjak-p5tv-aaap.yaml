severities: []
summary: 'The auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before
  5.7 provides debug messages containing authorized_keys command options, which allows
  remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information by reading
  these messages, as demonstrated by the shared user account required by Gitolite.
  NOTE: this can cross privilege boundaries because a user account may intentionally
  have no shell or filesystem access, and therefore may have no supported way to read
  an authorized_keys file in its own home directory.'
