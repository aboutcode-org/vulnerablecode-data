severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Open-iSCSI through 2.0.875. A local attacker can
  cause the iscsiuio server to abort or potentially execute code by sending messages
  with incorrect lengths, which (due to lack of checking) can lead to buffer overflows,
  and result in aborts (with overflow checking enabled) or code execution. The process_iscsid_broadcast
  function in iscsiuio/src/unix/iscsid_ipc.c does not validate the payload length
  before a write operation.
