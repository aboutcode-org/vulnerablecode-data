severities: []
summary: 'BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and
  are configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND''s default
  settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable
  by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration
  options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently
  used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server
  environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers.
  The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash
  of the named process. However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically
  possible. Affects: BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1
  -> 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.11-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition. Also
  release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch'
