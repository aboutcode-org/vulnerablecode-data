summary: 'In BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1
  -> 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as
  well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, BIND
  servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured
  to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND''s default settings
  the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable
  by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential
  configuration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG
  is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in
  mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain
  controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO implementation
  is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND
  was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can be used
  to trigger a buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled
  for 32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer
  overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined
  that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos
  libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC implementation
  unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users,
  we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND
  9.11 and 9.16 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally
  remove something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since
  system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation, we have made an exception
  in this case for reasons of stability and security.'
