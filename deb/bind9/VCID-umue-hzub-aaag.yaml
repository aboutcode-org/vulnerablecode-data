severities: []
summary: With pipelining enabled each incoming query on a TCP connection requires
  a similar resource allocation to a query received via UDP or via TCP without pipelining
  enabled. A client using a TCP-pipelined connection to a server could consume more
  resources than the server has been provisioned to handle. When a TCP connection
  with a large number of pipelined queries is closed, the load on the server releasing
  these multiple resources can cause it to become unresponsive, even for queries that
  can be answered authoritatively or from cache. (This is most likely to be perceived
  as an intermittent server problem).
