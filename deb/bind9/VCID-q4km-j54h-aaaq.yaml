summary: 'By design, BIND is intended to limit the number of TCP clients that can
  be connected at any given time. The number of allowed connections is a tunable parameter
  which, if unset, defaults to a conservative value for most servers. Unfortunately,
  the code which was intended to limit the number of simultaneous connections contained
  an error which could be exploited to grow the number of simultaneous connections
  beyond this limit. Versions affected: BIND 9.9.0 -> 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -> 9.11.6,
  9.12.0 -> 9.12.4, 9.14.0. BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition versions 9.9.3-S1 ->
  9.11.5-S3, and 9.11.5-S5. Versions 9.13.0 -> 9.13.7 of the 9.13 development branch
  are also affected. Versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for vulnerability
  to CVE-2018-5743.'
