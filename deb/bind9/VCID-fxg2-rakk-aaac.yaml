severities: []
summary: '"managed-keys" is a feature which allows a BIND resolver to automatically
  maintain the keys used by trust anchors which operators configure for use in DNSSEC
  validation. Due to an error in the managed-keys feature it is possible for a BIND
  server which uses managed-keys to exit due to an assertion failure if, during key
  rollover, a trust anchor''s keys are replaced with keys which use an unsupported
  algorithm. Versions affected: BIND 9.9.0 -> 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -> 9.11.5-P1, 9.12.0
  -> 9.12.3-P1, and versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.5-S3 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition.
  Versions 9.13.0 -> 9.13.6 of the 9.13 development branch are also affected. Versions
  prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for vulnerability to CVE-2018-5745.'
