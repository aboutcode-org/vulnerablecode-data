severities: []
summary: Using a specially-crafted message, an attacker may potentially cause a BIND
  server to reach an inconsistent state if the attacker knows (or successfully guesses)
  the name of a TSIG key used by the server. Since BIND, by default, configures a
  local session key even on servers whose configuration does not otherwise make use
  of it, almost all current BIND servers are vulnerable. In releases of BIND dating
  from March 2018 and after, an assertion check in tsig.c detects this inconsistent
  state and deliberately exits. Prior to the introduction of the check the server
  would continue operating in an inconsistent state, with potentially harmful results.
