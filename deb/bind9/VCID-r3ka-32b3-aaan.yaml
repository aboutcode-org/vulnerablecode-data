summary: In BIND 9.3.0 -> 9.11.35, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.21, and versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.35-S1
  and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.21-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release
  versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.18 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, exploitation of
  broken authoritative servers using a flaw in response processing can cause degradation
  in BIND resolver performance. The way the lame cache is currently designed makes
  it possible for its internal data structures to grow almost infinitely, which may
  cause significant delays in client query processing.
