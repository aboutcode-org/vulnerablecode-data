severities: []
summary: 'A malicious actor who intentionally exploits this lack of effective limitation
  on the number of fetches performed when processing referrals can, through the use
  of specially crafted referrals, cause a recursing server to issue a very large number
  of fetches in an attempt to process the referral. This has at least two potential
  effects: The performance of the recursing server can potentially be degraded by
  the additional work required to perform these fetches, and The attacker can exploit
  this behavior to use the recursing server as a reflector in a reflection attack
  with a high amplification factor.'
