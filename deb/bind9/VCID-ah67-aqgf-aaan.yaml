summary: 'An error in handling certain queries can cause an assertion failure when
  a server is using the nxdomain-redirect feature to cover a zone for which it is
  also providing authoritative service. A vulnerable server could be intentionally
  stopped by an attacker if it was using a configuration that met the criteria for
  the vulnerability and if the attacker could cause it to accept a query that possessed
  the required attributes. Please note: This vulnerability affects the "nxdomain-redirect"
  feature, which is one of two methods of handling NXDOMAIN redirection, and is only
  available in certain versions of BIND. Redirection using zones of type "redirect"
  is not affected by this vulnerability. Affects BIND 9.9.8-S1 -> 9.9.8-S3, 9.9.9-S1
  -> 9.9.9-S6, 9.11.0-9.11.0-P1.'
