summary: 'An error in zone database reference counting can lead to an assertion failure
  if a server which is running an affected version of BIND attempts several transfers
  of a slave zone in quick succession. This defect could be deliberately exercised
  by an attacker who is permitted to cause a vulnerable server to initiate zone transfers
  (for example: by sending valid NOTIFY messages), causing the named process to exit
  after failing the assertion test. Affects BIND 9.12.0 and 9.12.1.'
