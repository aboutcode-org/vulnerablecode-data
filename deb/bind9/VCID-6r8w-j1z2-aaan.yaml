  can occur in versions which support EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) features. In those
  versions which have ECS support, enabling nxdomain-redirect is likely to lead to
  BIND exiting due to assertion failure. Versions affected: BIND Supported Preview
  Edition version 9.10.5-S1 -> 9.11.5-S5. ONLY BIND Supported Preview Edition releases
  are affected.'
