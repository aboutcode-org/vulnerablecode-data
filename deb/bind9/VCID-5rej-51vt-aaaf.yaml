summary: 'Change #4777 (introduced in October 2017) introduced an unforeseen issue
  in releases which were issued after that date, affecting which clients are permitted
  to make recursive queries to a BIND nameserver. The intended (and documented) behavior
  is that if an operator has not specified a value for the "allow-recursion" setting,
  it SHOULD default to one of the following: none, if "recursion no;" is set in named.conf;
  a value inherited from the "allow-query-cache" or "allow-query" settings IF "recursion
  yes;" (the default for that setting) AND match lists are explicitly set for "allow-query-cache"
  or "allow-query" (see the BIND9 Administrative Reference Manual section 6.2 for
  more details); or the intended default of "allow-recursion {localhost; localnets;};"
  if "recursion yes;" is in effect and no values are explicitly set for "allow-query-cache"
  or "allow-query". However, because of the regression introduced by change #4777,
  it is possible when "recursion yes;" is in effect and no match list values are provided
  for "allow-query-cache" or "allow-query" for the setting of "allow-recursion" to
  inherit a setting of all hosts from the "allow-query" setting default, improperly
  permitting recursion to all clients. Affects BIND 9.9.12, 9.10.7, 9.11.3, 9.12.0->9.12.1-P2,
  the development release 9.13.0, and also releases 9.9.12-S1, 9.10.7-S1, 9.11.3-S1,
  and 9.11.3-S2 from BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition.'
