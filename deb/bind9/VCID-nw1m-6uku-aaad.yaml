summary: A problem with the implementation of the new serve-stale feature in BIND
  9.12 can lead to an assertion failure in rbtdb.c, even when stale-answer-enable
  is off. Additionally, problematic interaction between the serve-stale feature and
  NSEC aggressive negative caching can in some cases cause undesirable behavior from
  named, such as a recursion loop or excessive logging. Deliberate exploitation of
  this condition could cause operational problems depending on the particular manifestation
  -- either degradation or denial of service. Affects BIND 9.12.0 and 9.12.1.
