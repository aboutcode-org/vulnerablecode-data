summary: 'In ISC BIND9 versions BIND 9.11.14 -> 9.11.19, BIND 9.14.9 -> 9.14.12, BIND
  9.16.0 -> 9.16.3, BIND Supported Preview Edition 9.11.14-S1 -> 9.11.19-S1: Unless
  a nameserver is providing authoritative service for one or more zones and at least
  one zone contains an empty non-terminal entry containing an asterisk ("*") character,
  this defect cannot be encountered. A would-be attacker who is allowed to change
  zone content could theoretically introduce such a record in order to exploit this
  condition to cause denial of service, though we consider the use of this vector
  unlikely because any such attack would require a significant privilege level and
  be easily traceable.'
