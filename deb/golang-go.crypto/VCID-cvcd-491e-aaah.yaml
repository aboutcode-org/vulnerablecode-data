summary: An issue was discovered in supplementary Go cryptography libraries, aka golang-googlecode-go-crypto,
  before 2019-03-20. A flaw was found in the amd64 implementation of golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20
  and golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20/salsa. If more than 256 GiB of keystream is generated,
  or if the counter otherwise grows greater than 32 bits, the amd64 implementation
  will first generate incorrect output, and then cycle back to previously generated
  keystream. Repeated keystream bytes can lead to loss of confidentiality in encryption
  applications, or to predictability in CSPRNG applications.
