severities: []
summary: e2guardian v5.4.x <= v5.4.3r is affected by missing SSL certificate validation
  in the SSL MITM engine. In standalone mode (i.e., acting as a proxy or a transparent
  proxy), with SSL MITM enabled, e2guardian, if built with OpenSSL v1.1.x, did not
  validate hostnames in certificates of the web servers that it connected to, and
  thus was itself vulnerable to MITM attacks.
