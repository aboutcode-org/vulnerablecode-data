severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in the copying tool `nbdcopy` of libnbd. When performing
  multi-threaded copies using asynchronous nbd calls, nbdcopy was blindly treating
  the completion of an asynchronous command as successful, rather than checking the
  *error parameter. This could result in the silent creation of a corrupted destination
  image.
