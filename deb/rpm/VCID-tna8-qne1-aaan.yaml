severities: []
summary: RPM 4.4.x through 4.9.x, probably before 4.9.1.2, allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) and possibly execute arbitrary
  code via an rpm package with crafted headers and offsets that are not properly handled
  when a package is queried or installed, related to (1) the regionSwab function,
  (2) the headerLoad function, and (3) multiple functions in rpmio/rpmpgp.c.
