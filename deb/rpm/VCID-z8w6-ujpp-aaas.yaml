severities: []
summary: There is a flaw in RPM's signature functionality. OpenPGP subkeys are associated
  with a primary key via a "binding signature." RPM does not check the binding signature
  of subkeys prior to importing them. If an attacker is able to add or socially engineer
  another party to add a malicious subkey to a legitimate public key, RPM could wrongly
  trust a malicious signature. The greatest impact of this flaw is to data integrity.
  To exploit this flaw, an attacker must either compromise an RPM repository or convince
  an administrator to install an untrusted RPM or public key. It is strongly recommended
  to only use RPMs and public keys from trusted sources.
