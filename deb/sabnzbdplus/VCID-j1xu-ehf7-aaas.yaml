summary: SABnzbd is an open source binary newsreader. A vulnerability was discovered
  in SABnzbd that could trick the `filesystem.renamer()` function into writing downloaded
  files outside the configured Download Folder via malicious PAR2 files. A patch was
  released as part of SABnzbd 3.2.1RC1. As a workaround, limit downloads to NZBs without
  PAR2 files, deny write permissions to the SABnzbd process outside areas it must
  access to perform its job, or update to a fixed version.
