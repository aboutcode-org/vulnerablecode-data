severities: []
summary: A command execution issue was found in Apache SpamAssassin prior to 3.4.3.
  Carefully crafted nefarious Configuration (.cf) files can be configured to run system
  commands similar to CVE-2018-11805. This issue is less stealthy and attempts to
  exploit the issue will throw warnings. Thanks to Damian Lukowski at credativ for
  reporting the issue ethically. With this bug unpatched, exploits can be injected
  in a number of scenarios though doing so remotely is difficult. In addition to upgrading
  to SA 3.4.4, we again recommend that users should only use update channels or 3rd
  party .cf files from trusted places.
