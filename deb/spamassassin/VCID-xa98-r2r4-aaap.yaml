severities: []
summary: A command execution issue was found in Apache SpamAssassin prior to 3.4.3.
  Carefully crafted nefarious rule configuration (.cf) files can be configured to
  run system commands similar to CVE-2018-11805. With this bug unpatched, exploits
  can be injected in a number of scenarios including the same privileges as spamd
  is run which may be elevated though doing so remotely is difficult. In addition
  to upgrading to SA 3.4.4, we again recommend that users should only use update channels
  or 3rd party .cf files from trusted places. If you cannot upgrade, do not use 3rd
  party rulesets, do not use sa-compile and do not run spamd as an account with elevated
  privileges.
