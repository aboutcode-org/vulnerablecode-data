severities: []
summary: A denial of service vulnerability was identified that exists in Apache SpamAssassin
  before 3.4.2. The vulnerability arises with certain unclosed tags in emails that
  cause markup to be handled incorrectly leading to scan timeouts. In Apache SpamAssassin,
  using HTML::Parser, we setup an object and hook into the begin and end tag event
  handlers In both cases, the "open" event is immediately followed by a "close" event
  - even if the tag *does not* close in the HTML being parsed. Because of this, we
  are missing the "text" event to deal with the object normally. This can cause carefully
  crafted emails that might take more scan time than expected leading to a Denial
  of Service. The issue is possibly a bug or design decision in HTML::Parser that
  specifically impacts the way Apache SpamAssassin uses the module with poorly formed
  html. The exploit has been seen in the wild but not believed to have been purposefully
  part of a Denial of Service attempt. We are concerned that there may be attempts
  to abuse the vulnerability in the future.
