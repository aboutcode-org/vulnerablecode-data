severities: []
summary: An integer underflow in dpdk versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5
  in the `move_desc` function can lead to large amounts of CPU cycles being eaten
  up in a long running loop. An attacker could cause `move_desc` to get stuck in a
  4,294,967,295-count iteration loop. Depending on how `vhost_crypto` is being used
  this could prevent other VMs or network tasks from being serviced by the busy DPDK
  lcore for an extended period.
