severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in DPDK version 19.11 and above that allows a malicious
  guest to cause a segmentation fault of the vhost-user backend application running
  on the host, which could result in a loss of connectivity for the other guests running
  on that host. This is caused by a missing validity check of the descriptor address
  in the function `virtio_dev_rx_batch_packed()`.
