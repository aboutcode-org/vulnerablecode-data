severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5.
  A flawed bounds checking in the copy_data function leads to a buffer overflow allowing
  an attacker in a virtual machine to write arbitrary data to any address in the vhost_crypto
  application. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality
  and integrity as well as system availability.
