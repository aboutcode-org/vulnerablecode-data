severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in dpdk. This flaw allows a malicious vhost-user master
  to attach an unexpected number of fds as ancillary data to VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD
  / VHOST_USER_SET_INFLIGHT_FD messages that are not closed by the vhost-user slave.
  By sending such messages continuously, the vhost-user master exhausts available
  fd in the vhost-user slave process, leading to a denial of service.
