severities: []
summary: GNU Tar through 1.30, when --sparse is used, mishandles file shrinkage during
  read access, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (infinite read
  loop in sparse_dump_region in sparse.c) by modifying a file that is supposed to
  be archived by a different user's process (e.g., a system backup running as root).
