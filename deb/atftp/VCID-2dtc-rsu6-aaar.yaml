summary: An issue was discovered in atftpd in atftp 0.7.1. A remote attacker may send
  a crafted packet triggering a stack-based buffer overflow due to an insecurely implemented
  strncpy call. The vulnerability is triggered by sending an error packet of 3 bytes
  or fewer. There are multiple instances of this vulnerable strncpy pattern within
  the code base, specifically within tftpd_file.c, tftp_file.c, tftpd_mtftp.c, and
  tftp_mtftp.c.
