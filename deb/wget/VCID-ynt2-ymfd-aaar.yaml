summary: set_file_metadata in xattr.c in GNU Wget before 1.20.1 stores a file's origin
  URL in the user.xdg.origin.url metadata attribute of the extended attributes of
  the downloaded file, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information (e.g.,
  credentials contained in the URL) by reading this attribute, as demonstrated by
  getfattr. This also applies to Referer information in the user.xdg.referrer.url
  metadata attribute. According to 2016-07-22 in the Wget ChangeLog, user.xdg.origin.url
  was partially based on the behavior of fwrite_xattr in tool_xattr.c in curl.
