severities: []
summary: 'debian/tor.init in the Debian tor_0.2.9.11-1~deb9u1 package for Tor was
  designed to execute aa-exec from the standard system pathname if the apparmor package
  is installed, but implements this incorrectly (with a wrong assumption that the
  specific pathname would remain the same forever), which allows attackers to bypass
  intended AppArmor restrictions by leveraging the silent loss of this protection
  mechanism. NOTE: this does not affect systems, such as default Debian stretch installations,
  on which Tor startup relies on a systemd unit file (instead of this tor.init script).'
