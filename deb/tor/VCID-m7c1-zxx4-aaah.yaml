summary: Tor before 0.1.2.16, when ControlPort is enabled, does not properly restrict
  commands to localhost port 9051, which allows remote attackers to modify the torrc
  configuration file, compromise anonymity, and have other unspecified impact via
  HTTP POST data containing commands without valid authentication, as demonstrated
  by an HTML form (1) hosted on a web site or (2) injected by a Tor exit node.
