summary: An issue was discovered in Tor before 0.2.9.15, 0.3.1.x before 0.3.1.10,
  and 0.3.2.x before 0.3.2.10. The directory-authority protocol-list subprotocol implementation
  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
  directory-authority crash) via a misformatted relay descriptor that is mishandled
  during voting.
