summary: Tor before 0.2.8.9 and 0.2.9.x before 0.2.9.4-alpha had internal functions
  that were entitled to expect that buf_t data had NUL termination, but the implementation
  of or/buffers.c did not ensure that NUL termination was present, which allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (client, hidden service, relay, or authority
  crash) via crafted data.
