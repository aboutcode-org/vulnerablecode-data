summary: Tor before 0.2.4.20, when OpenSSL 1.x is used in conjunction with a certain
  HardwareAccel setting on Intel Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge platforms, does not properly
  generate random numbers for (1) relay identity keys and (2) hidden-service identity
  keys, which might make it easier for remote attackers to bypass cryptographic protection
  mechanisms via unspecified vectors.
