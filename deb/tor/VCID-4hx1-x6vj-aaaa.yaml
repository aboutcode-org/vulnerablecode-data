summary: Tor before 0.2.4.23 and 0.2.5 before 0.2.5.6-alpha maintains a circuit after
  an inbound RELAY_EARLY cell is received by a client, which makes it easier for remote
  attackers to conduct traffic-confirmation attacks by using the pattern of RELAY
  and RELAY_EARLY cells as a means of communicating information about hidden service
  names.
