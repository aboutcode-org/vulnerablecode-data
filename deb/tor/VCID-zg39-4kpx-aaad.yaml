severities: []
summary: Tor before 0.2.2.34, when configured as a client or bridge, sends a TLS certificate
  chain as part of an outgoing OR connection, which allows remote relays to bypass
  intended anonymity properties by reading this chain and then determining the set
  of entry guards that the client or bridge had selected.
