summary: Tor 0.2.2.x before 0.2.2.7-alpha, when functioning as a directory mirror,
  does not prevent logging of the client IP address upon detection of erroneous client
  behavior, which might make it easier for local users to discover the identities
  of clients in opportunistic circumstances by reading log files.
