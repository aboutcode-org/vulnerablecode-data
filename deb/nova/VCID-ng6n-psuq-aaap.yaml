severities: []
summary: The VMWare driver in OpenStack Compute (Nova) 2013.2 through 2013.2.2 does
  not properly put VMs into RESCUE status, which allows remote authenticated users
  to bypass the quota limit and cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by
  requesting the VM be put into rescue and then deleting the image.
