summary: An issue was discovered in the default FilterScheduler in OpenStack Nova
  16.0.3. By repeatedly rebuilding an instance with new images, an authenticated user
  may consume untracked resources on a hypervisor host leading to a denial of service,
  aka doubled resource allocations. This regression was introduced with the fix for
  OSSA-2017-005 (CVE-2017-16239); however, only Nova stable/pike or later deployments
  with that fix applied and relying on the default FilterScheduler are affected.
