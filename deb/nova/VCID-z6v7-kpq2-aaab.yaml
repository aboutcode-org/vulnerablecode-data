summary: OpenStack Compute (Nova) Folsom, Grizzly, and earlier, when using Apache
  Qpid for the RPC backend, does not properly handle errors that occur during messaging,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connection pool consumption),
  as demonstrated using multiple requests that send long strings to an instance console
  and retrieving the console log.
