summary: This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute local PHP files on
  affected installations of Horde Groupware Webmail Edition 5.2.22. Authentication
  is required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within edit.php.

  this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of
  the www-data user. Was ZDI-CAN-10469.
