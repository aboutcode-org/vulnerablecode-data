severities: []
summary: An XSS issue was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition through 5.2.22
  (where the Horde_Text_Filter library before 2.3.7 is used). The attacker can send
  a plain text e-mail message, with JavaScript encoded as a link or email that is
  mishandled by preProcess in Text2html.php, because bespoke use of \x00\x00\x00 and
  \x01\x01\x01 interferes with XSS defenses.
