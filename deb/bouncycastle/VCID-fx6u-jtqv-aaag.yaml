summary: The default BKS keystore use an HMAC that is only 16 bits long, which can
  allow an attacker to compromise the integrity of a BKS keystore. Bouncy Castle release
  1.47 changes the BKS format to a format which uses a 160 bit HMAC instead. This
  applies to any BKS keystore generated prior to BC 1.47. For situations where people
  need to create the files for legacy reasons a specific keystore type "BKS-V1" was
  introduced in 1.49. It should be noted that the use of "BKS-V1" is discouraged by
  the library authors and should only be used where it is otherwise safe to do so,
  as in where the use of a 16 bit checksum for the file integrity check is not going
  to cause a security issue in itself.
