summary: XStream is an open source java library to serialize objects to XML and back
  again. Versions prior to 1.4.19 may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU
  time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a
  payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input
  stream. XStream 1.4.19 monitors and accumulates the time it takes to add elements
  to collections and throws an exception if a set threshold is exceeded. Users are
  advised to upgrade as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade may set the NO_REFERENCE
  mode to prevent recursion. See GHSA-rmr5-cpv2-vgjf for further details on a workaround
  if an upgrade is not possible.
