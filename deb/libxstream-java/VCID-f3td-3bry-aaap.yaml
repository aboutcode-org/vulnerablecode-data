summary: XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In
  XStream before version 1.4.15, a Server-Side Forgery Request vulnerability can be
  activated when unmarshalling. The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to request
  data from internal resources that are not publicly available only by manipulating
  the processed input stream. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security
  Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.15. The reported vulnerability
  does not exist if running Java 15 or higher. No user is affected who followed the
  recommendation to setup XStream's Security Framework with a whitelist! Anyone relying
  on XStream's default blacklist can immediately switch to a whilelist for the allowed
  types to avoid the vulnerability. Users of XStream 1.4.14 or below who still want
  to use XStream default blacklist can use a workaround described in more detailed
  in the referenced advisories.
