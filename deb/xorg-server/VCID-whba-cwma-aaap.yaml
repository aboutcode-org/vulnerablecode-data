severities: []
summary: It was found that xorg-x11-server before 1.19.0 including uses memcmp() to
  check the received MIT cookie against a series of valid cookies. If the cookie is
  correct, it is allowed to attach to the Xorg session. Since most memcmp() implementations
  return after an invalid byte is seen, this causes a time difference between a valid
  and invalid byte, which could allow an efficient brute force attack.
