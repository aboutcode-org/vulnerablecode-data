severities: []
summary: A PGP signature bypass flaw was found in fwupd (all versions), which could
  lead to the installation of unsigned firmware. As per upstream, a signature bypass
  is theoretically possible, but not practical because the Linux Vendor Firmware Service
  (LVFS) is either not implemented or enabled in versions of fwupd shipped with Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality
  and integrity.
