summary: 'Bip before 0.8.9, when running as a daemon, writes SSL handshake errors
  to an unexpected file descriptor that was previously associated with stderr before
  stderr has been closed, which allows remote attackers to write to other sockets
  and have an unspecified impact via a failed SSL handshake, a different vulnerability
  than CVE-2011-5268. NOTE: some sources originally mapped this CVE to two different
  types of issues; this CVE has since been SPLIT, producing CVE-2011-5268.'
