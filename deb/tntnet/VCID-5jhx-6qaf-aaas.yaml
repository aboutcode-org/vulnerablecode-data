severities: []
summary: framework/common/messageheaderparser.cpp in Tntnet before 2.2.1 allows remote
  attackers to obtain sensitive information via a header that ends in \n instead of
  \r\n, which prevents a null terminator from being added and causes Tntnet to include
  headers from other requests.
