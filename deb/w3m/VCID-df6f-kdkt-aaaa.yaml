summary: An issue was discovered in the Tatsuya Kinoshita w3m fork before 0.5.3-31.
  The feed_table_tag function in w3m doesn't properly validate the value of table
  span, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack and/or heap
  buffer overflow) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTML page.
