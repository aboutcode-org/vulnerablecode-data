summary: 'report_vbuild in report.c in Fetchmail before 6.4.20 sometimes omits initialization
  of the vsnprintf va_list argument, which might allow mail servers to cause a denial
  of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via long error messages. NOTE:
  it is unclear whether use of Fetchmail on any realistic platform results in an impact
  beyond an inconvenience to the client user.'
