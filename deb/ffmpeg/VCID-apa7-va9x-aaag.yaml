summary: The seg_write_packet function in libavformat/segment.c in ffmpeg 2.1.4 and
  earlier does not free the correct memory location, which allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service ("invalid memory handler") and possibly execute arbitrary
  code via a crafted video that triggers a use after free.
