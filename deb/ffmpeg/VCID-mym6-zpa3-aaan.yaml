severities: []
summary: The iff_read_header function in iff.c in libavformat in FFmpeg through 1.1.3
  does not properly handle data sizes for Interchange File Format (IFF) data during
  operations involving a CMAP chunk or a video codec, which allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (integer overflow, out-of-bounds array access, and
  application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted header.
