summary: The av_color_primaries_name function in libavutil/pixdesc.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3
  may return a NULL pointer depending on a value contained in a file, but callers
  do not anticipate this, as demonstrated by the avcodec_string function in libavcodec/utils.c,
  leading to a NULL pointer dereference. (It is also conceivable that there is security
  relevance for a NULL pointer dereference in av_color_primaries_name calls within
  the ffprobe command-line program.)
