summary: The vmd_decode function in libavcodec/vmdvideo.c in FFmpeg before 2.5.2 does
  not validate the relationship between a certain length value and the frame width,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array
  access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted Sierra VMD video data.
