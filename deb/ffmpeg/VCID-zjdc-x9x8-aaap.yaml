severities: []
summary: libavcodec/mjpegdec.c in FFmpeg before 2.4.2 considers only dimension differences,
  and not bits-per-pixel differences, when determining whether an image size has changed,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access)
  or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted MJPEG data.
