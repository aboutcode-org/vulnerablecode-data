summary: Prior to ffmpeg version 4.3, the tty demuxer did not have a 'read_probe'
  function assigned to it. By crafting a legitimate "ffconcat" file that references
  an image, followed by a file the triggers the tty demuxer, the contents of the second
  file will be copied into the output file verbatim (as long as the `-vcodec copy`
  option is passed to ffmpeg).
