summary: The ff_sbr_apply function in libavcodec/aacsbr.c in FFmpeg before 2.7.2 does
  not check for a matching AAC frame syntax element before proceeding with Spectral
  Band Replication calculations, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
  crafted AAC data.
