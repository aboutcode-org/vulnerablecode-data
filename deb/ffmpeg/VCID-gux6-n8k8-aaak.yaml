summary: The update_dimensions function in libavcodec/vp8.c in FFmpeg through 2.8.1,
  as used in Google Chrome before 46.0.2490.71 and other products, relies on a coefficient-partition
  count during multi-threaded operation, which allows remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service (race condition and memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via a crafted WebM file.
