summary: In libavformat/mxfdec.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3 -> 2.4, a DoS in mxf_read_index_entry_array()
  due to lack of an EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU consumption. When
  a crafted MXF file, which claims a large "nb_index_entries" field in the header
  but does not contain sufficient backing data, is provided, the loop would consume
  huge CPU resources, since there is no EOF check inside the loop. Moreover, this
  big loop can be invoked multiple times if there is more than one applicable data
  segment in the crafted MXF file.
