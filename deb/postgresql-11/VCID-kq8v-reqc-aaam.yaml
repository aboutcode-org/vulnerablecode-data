summary: PostgreSQL versions 10.x before 10.9 and versions 11.x before 11.4 are vulnerable
  to a stack-based buffer overflow. Any authenticated user can overflow a stack-based
  buffer by changing the user's own password to a purpose-crafted value. This often
  suffices to execute arbitrary code as the PostgreSQL operating system account.
