severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL versions before 13.1, before 12.5, before
  11.10, before 10.15, before 9.6.20 and before 9.5.24. If a client application that
  creates additional database connections only reuses the basic connection parameters
  while dropping security-relevant parameters, an opportunity for a man-in-the-middle
  attack, or the ability to observe clear-text transmissions, could exist. The highest
  threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well
  as system availability.
