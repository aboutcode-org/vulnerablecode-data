summary: An information leak was discovered in postgresql in versions before 13.2,
  before 12.6 and before 11.11. A user having UPDATE permission but not SELECT permission
  to a particular column could craft queries which, under some circumstances, might
  disclose values from that column in error messages. An attacker could use this flaw
  to obtain information stored in a column they are allowed to write but not read.
