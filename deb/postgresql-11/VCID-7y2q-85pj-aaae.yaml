summary: A flaw was found in postgresql. A purpose-crafted query can read arbitrary
  bytes of server memory. In the default configuration, any authenticated database
  user can complete this attack at will. The attack does not require the ability to
  create objects. If server settings include max_worker_processes=0, the known versions
  of this attack are infeasible. However, undiscovered variants of the attack may
  be independent of that setting.
