summary: A vulnerability was found in postgresql versions 11.x prior to 11.3. The
  Windows installer for BigSQL-supplied PostgreSQL does not lock down the ACL of the
  binary installation directory or the ACL of the data directory; it keeps the inherited
  ACL. In the default configuration, an attacker having both an unprivileged Windows
  account and an unprivileged PostgreSQL account can cause the PostgreSQL service
  account to execute arbitrary code. An attacker having only the unprivileged Windows
  account can read arbitrary data directory files, essentially bypassing database-imposed
  read access limitations. An attacker having only the unprivileged Windows account
  can also delete certain data directory files.
