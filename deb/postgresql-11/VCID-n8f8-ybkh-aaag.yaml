summary: A vulnerability was found in postgresql versions 11.x prior to 11.3. The
  Windows installer for EnterpriseDB-supplied PostgreSQL does not lock down the ACL
  of the binary installation directory or the ACL of the data directory; it keeps
  the inherited ACL. In the default configuration, this allows a local attacker to
  read arbitrary data directory files, essentially bypassing database-imposed read
  access limitations. In plausible non-default configurations, an attacker having
  both an unprivileged Windows account and an unprivileged PostgreSQL account can
  cause the PostgreSQL service account to execute arbitrary code.
