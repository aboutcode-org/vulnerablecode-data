summary: The Windows installer for PostgreSQL 9.5 - 12 invokes system-provided executables
  that do not have fully-qualified paths. Executables in the directory where the installer
  loads or the current working directory take precedence over the intended executables.
  An attacker having permission to add files into one of those directories can use
  this to execute arbitrary code with the installer's administrative rights.
