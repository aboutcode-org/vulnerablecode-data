summary: Apache Subversion SVN authz protected copyfrom paths regression Subversion
  servers reveal 'copyfrom' paths that should be hidden according to configured path-based
  authorization (authz) rules. When a node has been copied from a protected location,
  users with access to the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This
  also reveals the fact that the node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed;
  not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are vulnerable.
