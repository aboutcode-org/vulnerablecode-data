severities: []
summary: lighttpd before 1.4.33 does not check the return value of the (1) setuid,
  (2) setgid, or (3) setgroups functions, which might cause lighttpd to run as root
  if it is restarted and allows remote attackers to gain privileges, as demonstrated
  by multiple calls to the clone function that cause setuid to fail when the user
  process limit is reached.
