summary: '** DISPUTED ** lighttpd before 1.4.54 has a signed integer overflow, which
  might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
  possibly have unspecified other impact via a malicious HTTP GET request, as demonstrated
  by mishandling of /%2F? in burl_normalize_2F_to_slash_fix in burl.c. NOTE: The developer
  states "The feature which can be abused to cause the crash is a new feature in lighttpd
  1.4.50, and is not enabled by default. It must be explicitly configured in the config
  file (e.g. lighttpd.conf). Certain input will trigger an abort() in lighttpd when
  that feature is enabled. lighttpd detects the underflow or realloc() will fail (in
  both 32-bit and 64-bit executables), also detected in lighttpd. Either triggers
  an explicit abort() by lighttpd. This is not exploitable beyond triggering the explicit
  abort() with subsequent application exit."'
