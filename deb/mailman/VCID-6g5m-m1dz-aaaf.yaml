severities: []
summary: GNU Mailman 2.x before 2.1.30 uses the .obj extension for scrubbed application/octet-stream
  MIME parts. This behavior may contribute to XSS attacks against list-archive visitors,
  because an HTTP reply from an archive web server may lack a MIME type, and a web
  browser may perform MIME sniffing, conclude that the MIME type should have been
  text/html, and execute JavaScript code.
