summary: The keycompare_mb function in sort.c in sort in GNU Coreutils through 8.23
  on 64-bit platforms performs a size calculation without considering the number of
  bytes occupied by multibyte characters, which allows attackers to cause a denial
  of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via long UTF-8 strings.
