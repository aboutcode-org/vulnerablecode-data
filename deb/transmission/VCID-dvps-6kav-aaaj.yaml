severities: []
summary: Transmission through 2.92 relies on X-Transmission-Session-Id (which is not
  a forbidden header for Fetch) for access control, which allows remote attackers
  to execute arbitrary RPC commands, and consequently write to arbitrary files, via
  POST requests to /transmission/rpc in conjunction with a DNS rebinding attack.
