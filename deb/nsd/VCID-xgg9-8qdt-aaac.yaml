severities: []
summary: NLnet Labs Unbound, up to and including version 1.12.0, and NLnet Labs NSD,
  up to and including version 4.3.3, contain a local vulnerability that would allow
  for a local symlink attack. When writing the PID file, Unbound and NSD create the
  file if it is not there, or open an existing file for writing. In case the file
  was already present, they would follow symlinks if the file happened to be a symlink
  instead of a regular file. An additional chown of the file would then take place
  after it was written, making the user Unbound/NSD is supposed to run as the new
  owner of the file. If an attacker has local access to the user Unbound/NSD runs
  as, she could create a symlink in place of the PID file pointing to a file that
  she would like to erase. If then Unbound/NSD is killed and the PID file is not cleared,
  upon restarting with root privileges, Unbound/NSD will rewrite any file pointed
  at by the symlink. This is a local vulnerability that could create a Denial of Service
  of the system Unbound/NSD is running on. It requires an attacker having access to
  the limited permission user Unbound/NSD runs as and point through the symlink to
  a critical file on the system.
