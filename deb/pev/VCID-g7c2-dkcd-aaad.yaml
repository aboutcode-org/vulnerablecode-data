summary: A Buffer Overflow vulnerabilityexists in Pev 0.81 via the pe_exports function
  from exports.c.. The array offsets_to_Names is dynamically allocated on the stack
  using exp->NumberOfFunctions as its size. However, the loop uses exp->NumberOfNames
  to iterate over it and set its components value. Therefore, the loop code assumes
  that exp->NumberOfFunctions is greater than ordinal at each iteration. This can
  lead to arbitrary code execution.
