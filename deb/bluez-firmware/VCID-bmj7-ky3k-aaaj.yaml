severities: []
summary: The Bluetooth Classic implementation in the Cypress WICED BT stack through
  2.9.0 for CYW20735B1 does not properly handle the reception of a malformed LMP timing
  accuracy response followed by multiple reconnections to the link slave, allowing
  attackers to exhaust device BT resources and eventually trigger a crash via multiple
  attempts of sending a crafted LMP timing accuracy response followed by a sudden
  reconnection with a random BDAddress.
