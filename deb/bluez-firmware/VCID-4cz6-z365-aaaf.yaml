severities: []
summary: The Bluetooth Classic implementation in the Cypress WICED BT stack through
  2.9.0 for CYW20735B1 devices does not properly handle the reception of LMP_max_slot
  with an invalid Baseband packet type (and LT_ADDRESS and LT_ADDR) after completion
  of the LMP setup procedure, allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a denial
  of service (firmware crash) via a crafted LMP packet.
