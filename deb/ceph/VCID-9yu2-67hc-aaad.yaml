severities: []
summary: User credentials can be manipulated and stolen by Native CephFS consumers
  of OpenStack Manila, resulting in potential privilege escalation. An Open Stack
  Manila user can request access to a share to an arbitrary cephx user, including
  existing users. The access key is retrieved via the interface drivers. Then, all
  users of the requesting OpenStack project can view the access key. This enables
  the attacker to target any resource that the user has access to. This can be done
  to even "admin" users, compromising the ceph administrator. This flaw affects Ceph
  versions prior to 14.2.16, 15.x prior to 15.2.8, and 16.x prior to 16.2.0.
