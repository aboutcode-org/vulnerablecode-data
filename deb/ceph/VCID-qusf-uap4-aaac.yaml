summary: A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway)
  in versions before 14.2.21. The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP
  headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag
  in the CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when
  the CORS request is made. In addition, the prior bug fix for CVE-2020-10753 did
  not account for the use of \r as a header separator, thus a new flaw has been created.
