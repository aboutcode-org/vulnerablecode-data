severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in the Cephx authentication protocol in versions before
  15.2.6 and before 14.2.14, where it does not verify Ceph clients correctly and is
  then vulnerable to replay attacks in Nautilus. This flaw allows an attacker with
  access to the Ceph cluster network to authenticate with the Ceph service via a packet
  sniffer and perform actions allowed by the Ceph service. This issue is a reintroduction
  of CVE-2018-1128, affecting the msgr2 protocol. The msgr 2 protocol is used for
  all communication except older clients that do not support the msgr2 protocol. The
  msgr1 protocol is not affected. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
  confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.
