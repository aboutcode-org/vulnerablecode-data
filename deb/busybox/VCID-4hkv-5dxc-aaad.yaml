severities: []
summary: In the add_match function in libbb/lineedit.c in BusyBox through 1.27.2,
  the tab autocomplete feature of the shell, used to get a list of filenames in a
  directory, does not sanitize filenames and results in executing any escape sequence
  in the terminal. This could potentially result in code execution, arbitrary file
  writes, or other attacks.
