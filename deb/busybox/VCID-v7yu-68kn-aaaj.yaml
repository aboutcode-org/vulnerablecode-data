severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in BusyBox before 1.30.0. An out of bounds read in
  udhcp components (consumed by the DHCP server, client, and relay) allows a remote
  attacker to leak sensitive information from the stack by sending a crafted DHCP
  message. This is related to verification in udhcp_get_option() in networking/udhcp/common.c
  that 4-byte options are indeed 4 bytes.
