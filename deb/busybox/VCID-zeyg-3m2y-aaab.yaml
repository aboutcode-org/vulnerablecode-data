summary: 'An issue was discovered in BusyBox through 1.30.0. An out of bounds read
  in udhcp components (consumed by the DHCP client, server, and/or relay) might allow
  a remote attacker to leak sensitive information from the stack by sending a crafted
  DHCP message. This is related to assurance of a 4-byte length when decoding DHCP_SUBNET.
  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-20679.'
