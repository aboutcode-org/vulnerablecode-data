summary: libspice, as used in QEMU-KVM in the Hypervisor (aka rhev-hypervisor) in
  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) 2.2 and qspice 0.3.0, does not properly
  restrict the addresses upon which memory-management actions are performed, which
  allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) or possibly
  gain privileges via unspecified vectors.
