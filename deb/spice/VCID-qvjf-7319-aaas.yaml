summary: libspice, as used in QEMU-KVM in the Hypervisor (aka rhev-hypervisor) in
  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) 2.2 and qspice 0.3.0, does not properly
  validate guest QXL driver pointers, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial
  of service (invalid pointer dereference and guest OS crash) or possibly gain privileges
  via unspecified vectors.
