summary: Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities were found in the QUIC image decoding
  process of the SPICE remote display system, before spice-0.14.2-1. Both the SPICE
  client (spice-gtk) and server are affected by these flaws. These flaws allow a malicious
  client or server to send specially crafted messages that, when processed by the
  QUIC image compression algorithm, result in a process crash or potential code execution.
