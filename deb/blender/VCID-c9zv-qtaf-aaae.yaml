summary: An exploitable integer overflow exists in the upgrade of the legacy Mesh
  attribute 'tface' of the Blender open-source 3d creation suite v2.78c. A specially
  crafted .blend file can cause an integer overflow resulting in a buffer overflow
  which can allow for code execution under the context of the application. An attacker
  can convince a user to open the file or use it as a library in order to trigger
  this vulnerability.
