summary: An exploitable integer overflow exists in the DPX loading functionality of
  the Blender open-source 3d creation suite version 2.78c. A specially crafted '.cin'
  file can cause an integer overflow resulting in a buffer overflow which can allow
  for code execution under the context of the application. An attacker can convince
  a user to use the file as an asset via the sequencer in order to trigger this vulnerability.
