summary: An exploitable integer overflow exists in the way that the Blender open-source
  3d creation suite v2.78c converts text rendered as a font into a curve. A specially
  crafted .blend file can cause an integer overflow resulting in a buffer overflow
  which can allow for code execution under the context of the application. An attacker
  can convince a user to open the file or use the file as a library in order to trigger
  this vulnerability.
