summary: An exploitable integer overflow exists in the 'CustomData' Mesh loading functionality
  of the Blender open-source 3d creation suite. A .blend file with a specially crafted
  external data file can cause an integer overflow resulting in a buffer overflow
  which can allow for code execution under the context of the application. An attacker
  can convince a user to edit an object within a .blend library in their Scene in
  order to trigger this vulnerability.
