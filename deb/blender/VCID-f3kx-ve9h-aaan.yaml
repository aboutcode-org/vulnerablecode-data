summary: An exploitable integer overflow exists in the animation playing functionality
  of the Blender open-source 3d creation suite version 2.78c. A specially created

  allow for code execution under the context of the application. An attacker can convince
  a user to use the file as an asset in order to trigger this vulnerability.
