severities: []
summary: The _compile function in Maketext.pm in the Locale::Maketext implementation
  in Perl before 5.17.7 does not properly handle backslashes and fully qualified method
  names during compilation of bracket notation, which allows context-dependent attackers
  to execute arbitrary commands via crafted input to an application that accepts translation
  strings from users, as demonstrated by the TWiki application before 5.1.3, and the
  Foswiki application 1.0.x through 1.0.10 and 1.1.x through 1.1.6.
