severities: []
summary: Leptonica 1.74.4 constructs unintended pathnames (containing duplicated path
  components) when operating on files in /tmp subdirectories, which might allow local
  users to bypass intended file restrictions by leveraging access to a directory located
  deeper within the /tmp directory tree, as demonstrated by /tmp/ANY/PATH/ANY/PATH/input.tif.
