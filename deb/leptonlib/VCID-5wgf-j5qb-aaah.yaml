severities: []
summary: Leptonica before 1.75.3 does not limit the number of characters in a %s format
  argument to fscanf or sscanf, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact
  via a long string, as demonstrated by the gplotRead and ptaReadStream functions.
