summary: Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) CNI (Container Networking Interface)
  0.7.4 has a network firewall misconfiguration which affects Kubernetes. The CNI
  'portmap' plugin, used to setup HostPorts for CNI, inserts rules at the front of
  the iptables nat chains; which take precedence over the KUBE- SERVICES chain. Because
  of this, the HostPort/portmap rule could match incoming traffic even if there were
  better fitting, more specific service definition rules like NodePorts later in the
  chain. The issue is fixed in CNI 0.7.5 and Kubernetes 1.11.9, 1.12.7, 1.13.5, and
  1.14.0.
