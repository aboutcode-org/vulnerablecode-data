severities: []
summary: An integer underflow issue exists in ntfs-3g 2017.3.23. A local attacker
  could potentially exploit this by running /bin/ntfs-3g with specially crafted arguments
  from a specially crafted directory to cause a heap buffer overflow, resulting in
  a crash or the ability to execute arbitrary code. In installations where /bin/ntfs-3g
  is a setuid-root binary, this could lead to a local escalation of privileges.
