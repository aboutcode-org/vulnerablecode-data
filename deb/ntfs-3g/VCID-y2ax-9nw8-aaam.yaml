severities: []
summary: 'In NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS attribute
  is supplied to the function ntfs_get_attribute_value, a heap buffer overflow can
  occur allowing for memory disclosure or denial of service. The vulnerability is
  caused by an out-of-bound buffer access which can be triggered by mounting a crafted
  ntfs partition. The root cause is a missing consistency check after reading an MFT
  record : the "bytes_in_use" field should be less than the "bytes_allocated" field.
  When it is not, the parsing of the records proceeds into the wild.'
