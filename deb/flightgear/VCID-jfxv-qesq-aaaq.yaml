severities: []
summary: 'In FlightGear before 2017.2.1, the FGCommand interface allows overwriting
  any file the user has write access to, but not with arbitrary data: only with the
  contents of a FlightGear flightplan (XML). A resource such as a malicious third-party
  aircraft could exploit this to damage files belonging to the user. Both this issue
  and CVE-2016-9956 are directory traversal vulnerabilities in Autopilot/route_mgr.cxx
  - this one exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-9956.'
