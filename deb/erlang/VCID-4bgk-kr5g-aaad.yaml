summary: A local privilege escalation vulnerability was discovered in Erlang/OTP prior
  to version 23.2.3. By adding files to an existing installation's directory, a local
  attacker could hijack accounts of other users running Erlang programs or possibly
  coerce a service running with "erlsrv.exe" to execute arbitrary code as Local System.
  This can occur only under specific conditions on Windows with unsafe filesystem
  permissions.
