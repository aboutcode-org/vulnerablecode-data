severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Erlang/OTP 18.x. Erlang's generation of compiled
  regular expressions is vulnerable to a heap overflow. Regular expressions using
  a malformed extpattern can indirectly specify an offset that is used as an array
  index. This ordinal permits arbitrary regions within the erts_alloc arena to be
  both read and written to.
