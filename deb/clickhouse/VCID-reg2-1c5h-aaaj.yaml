severities: []
summary: Heap out-of-bounds read in Clickhouse's LZ4 compression codec when parsing
  a malicious query. As part of the LZ4::decompressImpl() loop, a 16-bit unsigned
  user-supplied value ('offset') is read from the compressed data. The offset is later
  used in the length of a copy operation, without checking the upper bounds of the
  source of the copy operation.
