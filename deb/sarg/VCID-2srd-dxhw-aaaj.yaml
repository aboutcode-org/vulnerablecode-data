severities: []
summary: log.c in Squid Analysis Report Generator (sarg) through 2.3.11 allows local
  privilege escalation. By default, it uses a fixed temporary directory /tmp/sarg.
  As the root user, sarg creates this directory or reuses an existing one in an insecure
  manner. An attacker can pre-create the directory, and place symlinks in it (after
  winning a /tmp/sarg/denied.int_unsort race condition). The outcome will be corrupted
  or newly created files in privileged file system locations.
