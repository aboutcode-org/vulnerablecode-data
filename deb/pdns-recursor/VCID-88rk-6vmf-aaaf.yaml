summary: PowerDNS Recursor from 4.1.0 up to and including 4.3.0 does not sufficiently
  defend against amplification attacks. An issue in the DNS protocol has been found
  that allow malicious parties to use recursive DNS services to attack third party
  authoritative name servers. The attack uses a crafted reply by an authoritative
  name server to amplify the resulting traffic between the recursive and other authoritative
  name servers. Both types of service can suffer degraded performance as an effect.
  This is triggered by random subdomains in the NSDNAME in NS records. PowerDNS Recursor
  4.1.16, 4.2.2 and 4.3.1 contain a mitigation to limit the impact of this DNS protocol
  issue.
