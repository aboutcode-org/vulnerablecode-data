severities: []
summary: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 up to and including
  4.1.4. A remote attacker sending a DNS query for a meta-type like OPT can lead to
  a zone being wrongly cached as failing DNSSEC validation. It only arises if the
  parent zone is signed, and all the authoritative servers for that parent zone answer
  with FORMERR to a query for at least one of the meta-types. As a result, subsequent
  queries from clients requesting DNSSEC validation will be answered with a ServFail.
