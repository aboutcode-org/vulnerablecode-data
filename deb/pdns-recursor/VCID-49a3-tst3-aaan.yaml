severities: []
summary: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor before 4.1.18, 4.2.x before
  4.2.5, and 4.3.x before 4.3.5. A remote attacker can cause the cached records for
  a given name to be updated to the Bogus DNSSEC validation state, instead of their
  actual DNSSEC Secure state, via a DNS ANY query. This results in a denial of service
  for installation that always validate (dnssec=validate), and for clients requesting
  validation when on-demand validation is enabled (dnssec=process).
