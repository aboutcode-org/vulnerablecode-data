summary: Versions of Puppet Enterprise prior to 2016.4.5 or 2017.2.1 failed to mark
  MCollective server private keys as sensitive (a feature added in Puppet 4.6), so
  key values could be logged and stored in PuppetDB. These releases use the sensitive
  data type to ensure this won't happen anymore.
