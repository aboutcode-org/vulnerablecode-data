severities: []
summary: Versions of Puppet prior to 4.10.1 will deserialize data off the wire (from
  the agent to the server, in this case) with a attacker-specified format. This could
  be used to force YAML deserialization in an unsafe manner, which would lead to remote
  code execution. This change constrains the format of data on the wire to PSON or
  safely decoded YAML.
