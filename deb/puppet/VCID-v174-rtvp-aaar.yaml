summary: 'Puppet Server and PuppetDB provide useful performance and debugging information
  via their metrics API endpoints. For PuppetDB this may contain things like hostnames.
  Puppet Server reports resource names and titles for defined types (which may contain
  sensitive information) as well as function names and class names. Previously, these
  endpoints were open to the local network. PE 2018.1.13 & 2019.5.0, Puppet Server
  6.9.2 & 5.3.12, and PuppetDB 6.9.1 & 5.2.13 disable trapperkeeper-metrics /v1 metrics
  API and only allows /v2 access on localhost by default. This affects software versions:
  Puppet Enterprise 2018.1.x stream prior to 2018.1.13 Puppet Enterprise prior to
  2019.5.0 Puppet Server prior to 6.9.2 Puppet Server prior to 5.3.12 PuppetDB prior
  to 6.9.1 PuppetDB prior to 5.2.13 Resolved in: Puppet Enterprise 2018.1.13 Puppet
  Enterprise 2019.5.0 Puppet Server 6.9.2 Puppet Server 5.3.12 PuppetDB 6.9.1 PuppetDB
