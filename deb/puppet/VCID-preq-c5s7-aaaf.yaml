summary: Versions of Puppet Enterprise prior to 2016.4.5 or 2017.2.1 shipped with
  an MCollective configuration that allowed the package plugin to install or remove
  arbitrary packages on all managed agents. This release adds default configuration
  to not allow these actions. Customers who rely on this functionality can change
  this policy.
