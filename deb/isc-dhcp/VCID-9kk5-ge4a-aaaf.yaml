summary: 'There had existed in one of the ISC BIND libraries a bug in a function that
  was used by dhcpd when operating in DHCPv6 mode. There was also a bug in dhcpd relating
  to the use of this function per its documentation, but the bug in the library function
  prevented this from causing any harm. All releases of dhcpd from ISC contain copies
  of this, and other, BIND libraries in combinations that have been tested prior to
  release and are known to not present issues like this. Some third-party packagers
  of ISC software have modified the dhcpd source, BIND source, or version matchup
  in ways that create the crash potential. Based on reports available to ISC, the
  crash probability is large and no analysis has been done on how, or even if, the
  probability can be manipulated by an attacker. Affects: Builds of dhcpd versions
  prior to version 4.4.1 when using BIND versions 9.11.2 or later, or BIND versions
  with specific bug fixes backported to them. ISC does not have access to comprehensive
  version lists for all repackagings of dhcpd that are vulnerable. In particular,
  builds from other vendors may also be affected. Operators are advised to consult
  their vendor documentation.'
