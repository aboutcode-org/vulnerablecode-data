summary: ISC DHCP server 4.2 before 4.2.0-P2, when configured to use failover partnerships,
  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (communications-interrupted
  state and DHCP client service loss) by connecting to a port that is only intended
  for a failover peer, as demonstrated by a Nagios check_tcp process check to TCP
  port 520.
