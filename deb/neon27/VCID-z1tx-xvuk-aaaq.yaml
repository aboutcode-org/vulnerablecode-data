summary: neon before 0.28.6, when expat is used, does not properly detect recursion
  during entity expansion, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial
  of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document containing a
  large number of nested entity references, a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.
