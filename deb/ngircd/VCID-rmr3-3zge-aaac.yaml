summary: The (1) Conn_StartLogin and (2) cb_Read_Resolver_Result functions in conn.c
  in ngIRCd 18 through 20.2, when the configuration option NoticeAuth is enabled,
  does not properly handle the return code for the Handle_Write function, which allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and server crash)
  via unspecified vectors, related to a "notice auth" message not being sent to a
  new client.
