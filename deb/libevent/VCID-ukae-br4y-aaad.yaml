severities: []
summary: 'Multiple integer overflows in the evbuffer API in Libevent 1.4.x before
  1.4.15, 2.0.x before 2.0.22, and 2.1.x before 2.1.5-beta allow context-dependent
  attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have other unspecified impact
  via "insanely large inputs" to the (1) evbuffer_add, (2) evbuffer_expand, or (3)
  bufferevent_write function, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow or an infinite
  loop.  NOTE: this identifier has been SPLIT per ADT3 due to different affected versions.
  See CVE-2015-6525 for the functions that are only affected in 2.0 and later.'
