summary: 'Multiple integer overflows in the evbuffer API in Libevent 2.0.x before
  2.0.22 and 2.1.x before 2.1.5-beta allow context-dependent attackers to cause a
  denial of service or possibly have other unspecified impact via "insanely large
  inputs" to the (1) evbuffer_add, (2) evbuffer_prepend, (3) evbuffer_expand, (4)
  exbuffer_reserve_space, or (5) evbuffer_read function, which triggers a heap-based
  buffer overflow or an infinite loop.  NOTE: this identifier was SPLIT from CVE-2014-6272
  per ADT3 due to different affected versions.'
