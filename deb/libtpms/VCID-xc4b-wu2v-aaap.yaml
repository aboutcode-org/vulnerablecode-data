severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in libtpms in versions before 0.8.2. The commonly used integration
  of libtpms with OpenSSL contained a vulnerability related to the returned IV (initialization
  vector) when certain symmetric ciphers were used. Instead of returning the last
  IV it returned the initial IV to the caller, thus weakening the subsequent encryption
  and decryption steps. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.
