severities: []
summary: 'In lib/ofp-util.c in Open vSwitch (OvS) before 2.8.1, there are multiple
  memory leaks while parsing malformed OpenFlow group mod messages. NOTE: the vendor
  disputes the relevance of this report, stating "it can only be triggered by an OpenFlow
  controller, but OpenFlow controllers have much more direct and powerful ways to
  force Open vSwitch to allocate memory, such as by inserting flows into the flow
  table."'
