summary: A buffer overflow was discovered in libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801.
  The function xmlSnprintfElementContent in valid.c is supposed to recursively dump
  the element content definition into a char buffer 'buf' of size 'size'. The variable
  len is assigned strlen(buf). If the content->type is XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_ELEMENT,
  then (i) the content->prefix is appended to buf (if it actually fits) whereupon
  (ii) content->name is written to the buffer. However, the check for whether the
  content->name actually fits also uses 'len' rather than the updated buffer length
  strlen(buf). This allows us to write about "size" many bytes beyond the allocated
  memory. This vulnerability causes programs that use libxml2, such as PHP, to crash.
