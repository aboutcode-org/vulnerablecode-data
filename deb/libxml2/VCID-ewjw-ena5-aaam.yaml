summary: 'libxml2 through 2.9.1 does not properly handle external entities expansion
  unless an application developer uses the xmlSAX2ResolveEntity or xmlSetExternalEntityLoader
  function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption),
  send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or read arbitrary files via a crafted XML
  document, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue. NOTE: it could be argued that
  because libxml2 already provides the ability to disable external entity expansion,
  the responsibility for resolving this issue lies with application developers; according
  to this argument, this entry should be REJECTed and each affected application would
  need its own CVE.'
