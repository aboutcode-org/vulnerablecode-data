severities: []
summary: parser.c in libxml2 before 2.9.2 does not properly prevent entity expansion
  even when entity substitution has been disabled, which allows context-dependent
  attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document
  containing a large number of nested entity references, a variant of the "billion
  laughs" attack.
