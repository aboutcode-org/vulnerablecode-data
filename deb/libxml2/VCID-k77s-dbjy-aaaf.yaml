summary: libxml2 2.7.0 and 2.7.1 does not properly handle "predefined entities definitions"
  in entities, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
  (memory consumption and application crash), as demonstrated by use of xmllint on
  a certain XML document, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-1564 and CVE-2008-3281.
