severities: []
summary: The donote function in readelf.c in file through 5.20, as used in the Fileinfo
  component in PHP 5.4.34, does not ensure that sufficient note headers are present,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and
  application crash) via a crafted ELF file.
