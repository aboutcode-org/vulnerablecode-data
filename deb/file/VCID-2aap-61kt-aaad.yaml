severities: []
summary: The mget function in softmagic.c in file 5.x, as used in the Fileinfo component
  in PHP before 5.4.40, 5.5.x before 5.5.24, and 5.6.x before 5.6.8, does not properly
  maintain a certain pointer relationship, which allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a
  crafted string that is mishandled by a "Python script text executable" rule.
