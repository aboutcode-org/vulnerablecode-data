summary: The /webtools/control/xmlrpc endpoint in OFBiz XML-RPC event handler is exposed
  to External Entity Injection by passing DOCTYPE declarations with executable payloads
  that discloses the contents of files in the filesystem. In addition, it can also
  be used to probe for open network ports, and figure out from returned error messages
  whether a file exists or not. This affects OFBiz 16.11.01 to 16.11.04.
