severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in password-store.sh in pass in Simple Password Store
  1.7.x before 1.7.2. The signature verification routine parses the output of GnuPG
  with an incomplete regular expression, which allows remote attackers to spoof file
  signatures on configuration files and extension scripts. Modifying the configuration
  file allows the attacker to inject additional encryption keys under their control,
  thereby disclosing passwords to the attacker. Modifying the extension scripts allows
  the attacker arbitrary code execution.
