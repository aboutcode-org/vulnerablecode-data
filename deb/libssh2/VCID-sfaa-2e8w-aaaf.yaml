severities: []
summary: In libssh2 before 1.9.0, kex_method_diffie_hellman_group_exchange_sha256_key_exchange
  in kex.c has an integer overflow that could lead to an out-of-bounds read in the
  way packets are read from the server. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server
  may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service condition
  on the client system when a user connects to the server. This is related to an _libssh2_check_length
  mistake, and is different from the various issues fixed in 1.8.1, such as CVE-2019-3855.
