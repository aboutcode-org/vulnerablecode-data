severities: []
summary: In libssh2 v1.9.0 and earlier versions, the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in packet.c
  has an integer overflow in a bounds check, enabling an attacker to specify an arbitrary
  (out-of-bounds) offset for a subsequent memory read. A crafted SSH server may be
  able to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service condition on
  the client system when a user connects to the server.
