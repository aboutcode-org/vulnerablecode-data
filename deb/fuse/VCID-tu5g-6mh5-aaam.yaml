severities: []
summary: In fuse before versions 2.9.8 and 3.x before 3.2.5, fusermount is vulnerable
  to a restriction bypass when SELinux is active. This allows non-root users to mount
  a FUSE file system with the 'allow_other' mount option regardless of whether 'user_allow_other'
  is set in the fuse configuration. An attacker may use this flaw to mount a FUSE
  file system, accessible by other users, and trick them into accessing files on that
  file system, possibly causing Denial of Service or other unspecified effects.
