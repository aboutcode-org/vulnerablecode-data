severities: []
summary: init_tmp in TeeJee.FileSystem.vala in Timeshift before 20.03 unsafely reuses
  a preexisting temporary directory in the predictable location /tmp/timeshift. It
  follows symlinks in this location or uses directories owned by unprivileged users.
  Because Timeshift also executes scripts under this location, an attacker can attempt
  to win a race condition to replace scripts created by Timeshift with attacker-controlled
  scripts. Upon success, an attacker-controlled script is executed with full root
  privileges. This logic is practically always triggered when Timeshift runs regardless
  of the command-line arguments used.
