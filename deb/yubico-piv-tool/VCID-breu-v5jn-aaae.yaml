severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Yubico libykpiv before 2.1.0. lib/util.c in this
  library (which is included in yubico-piv-tool) does not properly check embedded
  length fields during device communication. A malicious PIV token can misreport the
  returned length fields during RSA key generation. This will cause stack memory to
  be copied into heap allocated memory that gets returned to the caller. The leaked
  memory could include PINs, passwords, key material, and other sensitive information
  depending on the integration. During further processing by the caller, this information
  could leak across trust boundaries. Note that RSA key generation is triggered by
  the host and cannot directly be triggered by the token.
