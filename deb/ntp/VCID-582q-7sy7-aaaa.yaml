summary: An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the origin timestamp
  check functionality of ntpd 4.2.8p9. A specially crafted unauthenticated network
  packet can be used to reset the expected origin timestamp for target peers. Legitimate
  replies from targeted peers will fail the origin timestamp check (TEST2) causing
  the reply to be dropped and creating a denial of service condition.
