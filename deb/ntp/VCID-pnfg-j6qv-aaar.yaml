summary: 'ntp-keygen in ntp 4.2.8px before 4.2.8p2-RC2 and 4.3.x before 4.3.12 does
  not generate MD5 keys with sufficient entropy on big endian machines when the lowest
  order byte of the temp variable is between 0x20 and 0x7f and not #, which might
  allow remote attackers to obtain the value of generated MD5 keys via a brute force
  attack with the 93 possible keys.'
