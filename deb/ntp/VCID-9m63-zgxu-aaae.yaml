summary: An attacker can spoof a packet from a legitimate ntpd server with an origin
  timestamp that matches the peer->dst timestamp recorded for that server. After making
  this switch, the client in NTP 4.2.8p4 and earlier and NTPSec aa48d001683e5b791a743ec9c575aaf7d867a2b0c
  will reject all future legitimate server responses. It is possible to force the
  victim client to move time after the mode has been changed. ntpq gives no indication
  that the mode has been switched.
