summary: ntpd in ntp before 4.2.8p14 and 4.3.x before 4.3.100 allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (daemon exit or system time change) by predicting transmit
  timestamps for use in spoofed packets. The victim must be relying on unauthenticated
  IPv4 time sources. There must be an off-path attacker who can query time from the
  victim's ntpd instance.
