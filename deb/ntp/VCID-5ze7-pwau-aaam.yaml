summary: ntpd in NTP 4.2.8p3 and NTPsec a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92 relies
  on the underlying operating system to protect it from requests that impersonate
  reference clocks. Because reference clocks are treated like other peers and stored
  in the same structure, any packet with a source ip address of a reference clock
  (127.127.1.1 for example) that reaches the receive() function will match that reference
  clock's peer record and will be treated as a trusted peer. Any system that lacks
  the typical martian packet filtering which would block these packets is in danger
  of having its time controlled by an attacker.
