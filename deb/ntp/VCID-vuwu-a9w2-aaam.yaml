severities: []
summary: The symmetric-key feature in the receive function in ntp_proto.c in ntpd
  in NTP 3.x and 4.x before 4.2.8p2 performs state-variable updates upon receiving
  certain invalid packets, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to
  cause a denial of service (synchronization loss) by spoofing the source IP address
  of a peer.
