summary: ntpd in ntp 4.2.8p10, 4.2.8p11, 4.2.8p12 and 4.2.8p13 allow remote attackers
  to prevent a broadcast client from synchronizing its clock with a broadcast NTP
  server via soofed mode 3 and mode 5 packets. The attacker must either be a part
  of the same broadcast network or control a slave in that broadcast network that
  can capture certain required packets on the attacker's behalf and send them to the
  attacker.
