summary: The read_network_packet function in ntp_io.c in ntpd in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p1
  on Linux and OS X does not properly determine whether a source IP address is an
  IPv6 loopback address, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof restricted
  packets, and read or write to the runtime state, by leveraging the ability to reach
  the ntpd machine's network interface with a packet from the ::1 address.
