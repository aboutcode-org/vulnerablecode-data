severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in the "Leaf and Chain" OCSP policy implementation in JSS'
  CryptoManager versions after 4.4.6, 4.5.3, 4.6.0, where it implicitly trusted the
  root certificate of a certificate chain. Applications using this policy may not
  properly verify the chain and could be vulnerable to attacks such as Man in the
  Middle.
