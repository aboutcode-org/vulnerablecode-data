severities: []
summary: In Bareos Director less than or equal to 16.2.10, 17.2.9, 18.2.8, and 19.2.7,
  a heap overflow allows a malicious client to corrupt the director's memory via oversized
  digest strings sent during initialization of a verify job. Disabling verify jobs
  mitigates the problem. This issue is also patched in Bareos versions 19.2.8, 18.2.9
  and 17.2.10.
