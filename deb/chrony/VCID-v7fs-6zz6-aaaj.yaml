summary: A flaw was found in chrony versions before 3.5.1 when creating the PID file
  under the /var/run/chrony folder. The file is created during chronyd startup while
  still running as the root user, and when it's opened for writing, chronyd does not
  check for an existing symbolic link with the same file name. This flaw allows an
  attacker with privileged access to create a symlink with the default PID file name
  pointing to any destination file in the system, resulting in data loss and a denial
  of service due to the path traversal.
