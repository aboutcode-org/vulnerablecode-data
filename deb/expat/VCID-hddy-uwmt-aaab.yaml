severities: []
summary: 'expat 2.1.0 and earlier does not properly handle entities expansion unless
  an application developer uses the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function, which allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption), send HTTP
  requests to intranet servers, or read arbitrary files via a crafted XML document,
  aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue. NOTE: it could be argued that because expat
  already provides the ability to disable external entity expansion, the responsibility
  for resolving this issue lies with application developers; according to this argument,
  this entry should be REJECTed, and each affected application would need its own
  CVE.'
