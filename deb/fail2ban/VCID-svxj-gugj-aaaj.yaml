severities: []
summary: fail2ban 0.8 and earlier does not properly parse sshd log files, which allows
  remote attackers to add arbitrary hosts to the /etc/hosts.deny file and cause a
  denial of service by adding arbitrary IP addresses to the sshd log file, as demonstrated
  by logging in via ssh with a client protocol version identification containing an
  IP address string, a different vector than CVE-2006-6302.
