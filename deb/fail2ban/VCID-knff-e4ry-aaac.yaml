severities: []
summary: filter.d/wuftpd.conf in Fail2ban 0.8.3 uses an incorrect regular expression
  that allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (forced authentication
  failures) via a crafted reverse-resolved DNS name (rhost) entry that contains a
  substring that is interpreted as an IP address, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-4321.
