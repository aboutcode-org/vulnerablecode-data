severities: []
summary: posix/JackSocket.cpp in libjack in JACK2 1.9.1 through 1.9.12 (as distributed
  with alsa-plugins 1.1.7 and later) has a "double file descriptor close" issue during
  a failed connection attempt when jackd2 is not running. Exploitation success depends
  on multithreaded timing of that double close, which can result in unintended information
  disclosure, crashes, or file corruption due to having the wrong file associated
  with the file descriptor.
