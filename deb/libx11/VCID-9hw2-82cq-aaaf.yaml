severities: []
summary: LookupCol.c in X.Org X through X11R7.7 and libX11 before 1.7.1 might allow
  remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The libX11 XLookupColor request (intended
  for server-side color lookup) contains a flaw allowing a client to send color-name
  requests with a name longer than the maximum size allowed by the protocol (and also
  longer than the maximum packet size for normal-sized packets). The user-controlled
  data exceeding the maximum size is then interpreted by the server as additional
  X protocol requests and executed, e.g., to disable X server authorization completely.
  For example, if the victim encounters malicious terminal control sequences for color
  codes, then the attacker may be able to take full control of the running graphical
  session.
