severities: []
summary: The ProcessGpsInfo function of the gpsinfo.c file of jhead 3.00 may allow
  a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack or unspecified other impact
  via a malicious JPEG file, because there is an integer overflow during a check for
  whether a location exceeds the EXIF data length. This is analogous to the CVE-2016-3822
  integer overflow in exif.c. This gpsinfo.c vulnerability is unrelated to the CVE-2018-16554
  gpsinfo.c vulnerability.
