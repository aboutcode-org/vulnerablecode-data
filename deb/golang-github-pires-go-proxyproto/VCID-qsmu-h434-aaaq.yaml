severities: []
summary: The package github.com/pires/go-proxyproto before 0.5.0 are vulnerable to
  Denial of Service (DoS) via the parseVersion1() function. The reader in this package
  is a default bufio.Reader wrapping a net.Conn. It will read from the connection
  until it finds a newline. Since no limits are implemented in the code, a deliberately
  malformed V1 header could be used to exhaust memory in a server process using this
  code - and create a DoS. This can be exploited by sending a stream starting with
  PROXY and continuing to send data (which does not contain a newline) until the target
  stops acknowledging. The risk here is small, because only trusted sources should
  be allowed to send proxy protocol headers.
