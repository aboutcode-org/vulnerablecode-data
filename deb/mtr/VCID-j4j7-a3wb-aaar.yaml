severities: []
summary: 'Stack-based buffer overflow in the split_redraw function in split.c in mtr
  before 0.73, when invoked with the -p (aka --split) option, allows remote attackers
  to execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS PTR record.  NOTE: it could be argued
  that this is a vulnerability in the ns_name_ntop function in resolv/ns_name.c in
  glibc and the proper fix should be in glibc; if so, then this should not be treated
  as a vulnerability in mtr.'
