severities: []
summary: The Catalyst-Plugin-Static-Simple module before 0.34 for Perl allows remote
  attackers to read arbitrary files if there is a '.' character anywhere in the pathname,
  which differs from the intended policy of allowing access only when the filename
  itself has a '.' character.
