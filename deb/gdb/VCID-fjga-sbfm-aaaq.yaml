severities: []
summary: GNU Debugger (GDB) 8.0 and earlier fails to detect a negative length field
  in a DWARF section. A malformed section in an ELF binary or a core file can cause
  GDB to repeatedly allocate memory until a process limit is reached. This can, for
  example, impede efforts to analyze malware with GDB.
