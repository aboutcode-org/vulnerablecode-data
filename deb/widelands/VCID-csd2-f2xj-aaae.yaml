summary: The pathname canonicalization functionality in io/filesystem/filesystem.cc
  in Widelands before 15.1 expands leading ~ (tilde) characters to home-directory
  pathnames but does not restrict use of these characters in strings received from
  the network, which might allow remote attackers to conduct absolute path traversal
  attacks and overwrite arbitrary files via a ~ in a pathname that is used for a file
  transfer in an Internet game, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1932.
