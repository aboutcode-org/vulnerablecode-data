summary: "A security vulnerability that can lead to local privilege escalation has\
  \ been found in \u2019guix-daemon\u2019. It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019\
  guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user\
  \ spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory\
  \ world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as\
  \ /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option\
  \ and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build\
  \ tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access\
  \ to the target file. Versions after and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and\
  \ versions prior to v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable."
