severities: []
summary: Redmine 0.8.7 and earlier uses the title tag before defining the character
  encoding in a meta tag, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks and inject arbitrary script via UTF-7 encoded values in the title
  parameter to a new issue page, which may be interpreted as script by Internet Explorer
  7 and 8.
