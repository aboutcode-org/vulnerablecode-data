summary: An issue was discovered in Valve Steam Client 2.10.91.91. The installer allows
  local users to gain NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges because some parts of %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Steam
  and/or %COMMONPROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Steam have weak permissions during a critical time
  window. An attacker can make this time window arbitrarily long by using opportunistic
  locks.
