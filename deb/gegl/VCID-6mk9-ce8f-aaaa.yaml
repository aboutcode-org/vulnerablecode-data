summary: An issue was discovered in GEGL through 0.3.32. The gegl_buffer_iterate_read_simple
  function in buffer/gegl-buffer-access.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (write access violation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
  a malformed PPM file, related to improper restrictions on memory allocation in the
  ppm_load_read_header function in operations/external/ppm-load.c.
