severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in SDDM before 0.19.0. It incorrectly starts the
  X server in a way that - for a short time period - allows local unprivileged users
  to create a connection to the X server without providing proper authentication.
  A local attacker can thus access X server display contents and, for example, intercept
  keystrokes or access the clipboard. This is caused by a race condition during Xauthority
  file creation.
