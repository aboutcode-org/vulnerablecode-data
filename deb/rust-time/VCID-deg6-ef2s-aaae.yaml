summary: In Rust time crate from version 0.2.7 and before version 0.2.23, unix-like
  operating systems may segfault due to dereferencing a dangling pointer in specific
  circumstances. This requires the user to set any environment variable in a different
  thread than the affected functions. The affected functions are time::UtcOffset::local_offset_at,
  time::UtcOffset::try_local_offset_at, time::UtcOffset::current_local_offset, time::UtcOffset::try_current_local_offset,
  time::OffsetDateTime::now_local and time::OffsetDateTime::try_now_local. Non-Unix
  targets are unaffected. This includes Windows and wasm. The issue was introduced
  in version 0.2.7 and fixed in version 0.2.23.
