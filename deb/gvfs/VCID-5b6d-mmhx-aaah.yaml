severities: []
summary: daemon/gvfsdaemon.c in gvfsd from GNOME gvfs before 1.38.3, 1.40.x before
  1.40.2, and 1.41.x before 1.41.3 opened a private D-Bus server socket without configuring
  an authorization rule. A local attacker could connect to this server socket and
  issue D-Bus method calls. (Note that the server socket only accepts a single connection,
  so the attacker would have to discover the server and connect to the socket before
  its owner does.)
