severities: []
summary: The DGifDecompressLine function in dgif_lib.c in GIFLIB (possibly version
  3.0.x), as later shipped in cgif.c in sam2p 0.49.4, has a heap-based buffer overflow
  because a certain CrntCode array index is not checked. This will lead to a denial
  of service or possibly unspecified other impact.
