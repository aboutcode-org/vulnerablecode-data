summary: The imagetruecolortopalette function in ext/gd/gd.c in PHP before 5.6.25
  and 7.x before 7.0.10 does not properly validate the number of colors, which allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (select_colors allocation error and
  out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a large value
  in the third argument.
