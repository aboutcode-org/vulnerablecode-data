severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in KTextEditor 5.34.0 through 5.45.0. Insecure handling
  of temporary files in the KTextEditor's kauth_ktexteditor_helper service (as utilized
  in the Kate text editor) can allow other unprivileged users on the local system
  to gain root privileges. The attack occurs when one user (who has an unprivileged
  account but is also able to authenticate as root) writes a text file using Kate
  into a directory owned by a another unprivileged user. The latter unprivileged user
  conducts a symlink attack to achieve privilege escalation.
