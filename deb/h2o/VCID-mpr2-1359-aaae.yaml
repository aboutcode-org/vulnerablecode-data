summary: h2o is an open source http server. In code prior to the `8c0eca3` commit
  h2o may attempt to access uninitialized memory. When receiving QUIC frames in certain
  order, HTTP/3 server-side implementation of h2o can be misguided to treat uninitialized
  memory as HTTP/3 frames that have been received. When h2o is used as a reverse proxy,
  an attacker can abuse this vulnerability to send internal state of h2o to backend
  servers controlled by the attacker or third party. Also, if there is an HTTP endpoint
  that reflects the traffic sent from the client, an attacker can use that reflector
  to obtain internal state of h2o. This internal state includes traffic of other connections
  in unencrypted form and TLS session tickets. This vulnerability exists in h2o server
  with HTTP/3 support, between commit 93af138 and d1f0f65. None of the released versions
  of h2o are affected by this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds. Users
  of unreleased versions of h2o using HTTP/3 are advised to upgrade immediately.
