severities: []
summary: The ElGamal implementation in Crypto++ through 8.5 allows plaintext recovery
  because, during interaction between two cryptographic libraries, a certain dangerous
  combination of the prime defined by the receiver's public key, the generator defined
  by the receiver's public key, and the sender's ephemeral exponents can lead to a
  cross-configuration attack against OpenPGP.
