severities: []
summary: KDE KAuth before 5.55 allows the passing of parameters with arbitrary types
  to helpers running as root over DBus via DBusHelperProxy.cpp. Certain types can
  cause crashes, and trigger the decoding of arbitrary images with dynamically loaded
  plugins. In other words, KAuth unintentionally causes this plugin code to run as
  root, which increases the severity of any possible exploitation of a plugin vulnerability.
