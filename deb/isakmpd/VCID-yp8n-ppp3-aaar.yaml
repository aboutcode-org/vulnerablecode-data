severities: []
summary: isakmpd in OpenBSD 3.8, 3.9, and possibly earlier versions, creates Security
  Associations (SA) with a replay window of size 0 when isakmpd acts as a responder
  during SA negotiation, which allows remote attackers to replay IPSec packets and
  bypass the replay protection.
