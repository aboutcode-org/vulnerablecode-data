summary: Google Chrome before 43.0.2357.65 relies on libvpx code that was not built
  with an appropriate --size-limit value, which allows remote attackers to trigger
  a negative value for a size field, and consequently cause a denial of service or
  possibly have unspecified other impact, via a crafted frame size in VP9 video data.
