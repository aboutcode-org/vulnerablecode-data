summary: 'An attempted excessive memory allocation was discovered in the function
  read_long_names in elf_begin.c in libelf in elfutils 0.174. Remote attackers could
  leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via crafted elf input,
  which leads to an out-of-memory exception. NOTE: The maintainers believe this is
  not a real issue, but instead a "warning caused by ASAN because the allocation is
  big. By setting ASAN_OPTIONS=allocator_may_return_null=1 and running the reproducer,
  nothing happens."'
