severities: []
summary: In elfutils 0.175, a heap-based buffer over-read was discovered in the function
  elf32_xlatetom in elf32_xlatetom.c in libelf. A crafted ELF input can cause a segmentation
  fault leading to denial of service (program crash) because ebl_core_note does not
  reject malformed core file notes.
