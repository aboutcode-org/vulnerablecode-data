severities: []
summary: Integer overflow in the check_section function in dwarf_begin_elf.c in the
  libdw library, as used in elfutils 0.153 and possibly through 0.158 allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
  code via a malformed compressed debug section in an ELF file, which triggers a heap-based
  buffer overflow.
