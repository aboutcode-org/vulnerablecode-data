summary: In systemd before v242-rc4, it was discovered that pam_systemd does not properly
  sanitize the environment before using the XDG_SEAT variable. It is possible for
  an attacker, in some particular configurations, to set a XDG_SEAT environment variable
  which allows for commands to be checked against polkit policies using the "allow_active"
  element rather than "allow_any".
