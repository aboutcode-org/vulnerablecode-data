summary: An issue was discovered in sd-bus in systemd 239. bus_process_object() in
  libsystemd/sd-bus/bus-objects.c allocates a variable-length stack buffer for temporarily
  storing the object path of incoming D-Bus messages. An unprivileged local user can
  exploit this by sending a specially crafted message to PID1, causing the stack pointer
  to jump over the stack guard pages into an unmapped memory region and trigger a
  denial of service (systemd PID1 crash and kernel panic).
