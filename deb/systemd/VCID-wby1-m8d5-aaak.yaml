severities: []
summary: In systemd through 233, certain sizes passed to dns_packet_new in systemd-resolved
  can cause it to allocate a buffer that's too small. A malicious DNS server can exploit
  this via a response with a specially crafted TCP payload to trick systemd-resolved
  into allocating a buffer that's too small, and subsequently write arbitrary data
  beyond the end of it.
