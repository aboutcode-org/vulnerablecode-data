severities: []
summary: It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can
  get new privileges through the execution of SUID binaries, which would allow to
  create binaries owned by the service transient group with the setgid bit set. A
  local attacker may use this flaw to access resources that will be owned by a potentially
  different service in the future, when the GID will be recycled.
