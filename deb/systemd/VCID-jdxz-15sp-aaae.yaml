summary: An allocation of memory without limits, that could result in the stack clashing
  with another memory region, was discovered in systemd-journald when many entries
  are sent to the journal socket. A local attacker, or a remote one if systemd-journal-remote
  is used, may use this flaw to crash systemd-journald or execute code with journald
  privileges. Versions through v240 are vulnerable.
