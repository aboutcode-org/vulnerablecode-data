severities: []
summary: systemd-tmpfiles in systemd through 237 mishandles symlinks present in non-terminal
  path components, which allows local users to obtain ownership of arbitrary files
  via vectors involving creation of a directory and a file under that directory, and
  later replacing that directory with a symlink. This occurs even if the fs.protected_symlinks
  sysctl is turned on.
