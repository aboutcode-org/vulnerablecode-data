severities: []
summary: It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can
  create a SUID/SGID binary that would be allowed to run as the transient service
  UID/GID even after the service is terminated. A local attacker may use this flaw
  to access resources that will be owned by a potentially different service in the
  future, when the UID/GID will be recycled.
