summary: '** DISPUTED ** systemd 239 through 245 accepts any certificate signed by
  a trusted certificate authority for DNS Over TLS. Server Name Indication (SNI) is
  not sent, and there is no hostname validation with the GnuTLS backend. NOTE: This
  has been disputed by the developer as not a vulnerability since hostname validation
  does not have anything to do with this issue (i.e. there is no hostname to be sent).'
