summary: In systemd prior to 234 a race condition exists between .mount and .automount
  units such that automount requests from kernel may not be serviced by systemd resulting
  in kernel holding the mountpoint and any processes that try to use said mount will
  hang. A race condition like this may lead to denial of service, until mount points
  are unmounted.
