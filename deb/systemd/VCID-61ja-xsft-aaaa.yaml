summary: It was discovered systemd does not correctly check the content of PIDFile
  files before using it to kill processes. When a service is run from an unprivileged
  user (e.g. User field set in the service file), a local attacker who is able to
  write to the PIDFile of the mentioned service may use this flaw to trick systemd
  into killing other services and/or privileged processes. Versions before v237 are
  vulnerable.
