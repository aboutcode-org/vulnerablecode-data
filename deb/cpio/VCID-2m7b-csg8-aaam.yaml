severities: []
summary: In all versions of cpio before 2.13 does not properly validate input files
  when generating TAR archives. When cpio is used to create TAR archives from paths
  an attacker can write to, the resulting archive may contain files with permissions
  the attacker did not have or in paths he did not have access to. Extracting those
  archives from a high-privilege user without carefully reviewing them may lead to
  the compromise of the system.
