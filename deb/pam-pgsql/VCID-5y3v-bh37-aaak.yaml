severities: []
summary: pam_sm_authenticate in pam_pgsql.c in libpam-pgsql 0.6.3 does not properly
  consider operator precedence when evaluating the success of a pam_get_pass function
  call, which allows local users to gain privileges via a SIGINT signal when this
  function is executing, as demonstrated by a CTRL-C sequence at a sudo password prompt
  in an "auth sufficient pam_pgsql.so" configuration.
