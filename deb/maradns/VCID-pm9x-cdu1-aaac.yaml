summary: MaraDNS before 1.3.07.12 and 1.4.x before 1.4.08 computes hash values for
  DNS data without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by
  sending many crafted queries with the Recursion Desired (RD) bit set.
