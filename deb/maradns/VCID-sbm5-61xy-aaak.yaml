summary: 'MaraDNS 1.3.07.12 and 1.4.08 computes hash values for DNS data without properly
  restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many crafted
  queries with the Recursion Desired (RD) bit set.  NOTE: this issue exists because
  of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0024.'
