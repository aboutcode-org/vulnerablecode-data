summary: In verify_emsa_pkcs1_signature() in gmp_rsa_public_key.c in the gmp plugin
  in strongSwan 4.x and 5.x before 5.7.0, the RSA implementation based on GMP does
  not reject excess data in the digestAlgorithm.parameters field during PKCS#1 v1.5
  signature verification. Consequently, a remote attacker can forge signatures when
  small public exponents are being used, which could lead to impersonation when only
  an RSA signature is used for IKEv2 authentication. This is a variant of CVE-2006-4790
  and CVE-2014-1568.
