summary: In verify_emsa_pkcs1_signature() in gmp_rsa_public_key.c in the gmp plugin
  in strongSwan 4.x and 5.x before 5.7.0, the RSA implementation based on GMP does
  not reject excess data after the encoded algorithm OID during PKCS#1 v1.5 signature
  verification. Similar to the flaw in the same version of strongSwan regarding digestAlgorithm.parameters,
  a remote attacker can forge signatures when small public exponents are being used,
  which could lead to impersonation when only an RSA signature is used for IKEv2 authentication.
