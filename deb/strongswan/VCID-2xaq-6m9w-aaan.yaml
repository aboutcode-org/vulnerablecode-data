summary: The compare_dn function in utils/identification.c in strongSwan 4.3.3 through
  5.1.1 allows (1) remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read,
  NULL pointer dereference, and daemon crash) or (2) remote authenticated users to
  impersonate arbitrary users and bypass access restrictions via a crafted ID_DER_ASN1_DN
  ID, related to an "insufficient length check" during identity comparison.
