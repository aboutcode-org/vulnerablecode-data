summary: The in-memory certificate cache in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote integer
  overflow upon receiving many requests with different certificates to fill the cache
  and later trigger the replacement of cache entries. The code attempts to select
  a less-often-used cache entry by means of a random number generator, but this is
  not done correctly. Remote code execution might be a slight possibility.
