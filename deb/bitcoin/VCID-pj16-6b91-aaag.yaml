summary: The alert functionality in bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before 0.7.0 supports
  different character representations of the same signature data, but relies on a
  hash of this signature, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (resource consumption) via a valid modified signature for a circulating alert.
