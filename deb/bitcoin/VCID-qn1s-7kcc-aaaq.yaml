summary: The Bitcoin protocol, as used in bitcoind before 0.4.4, wxBitcoin, Bitcoin-Qt,
  and other programs, does not properly handle multiple transactions with the same
  identifier, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (unspendable
  transaction) by leveraging the ability to create a duplicate coinbase transaction.
