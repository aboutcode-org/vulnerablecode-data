summary: Bitcoin Core before 0.14 allows an attacker to create an ostensibly valid
  SPV proof for a payment to a victim who uses an SPV wallet, even if that payment
  did not actually occur. Completing the attack would cost more than a million dollars,
  and is relevant mainly only in situations where an autonomous system relies solely
  on an SPV proof for transactions of a greater dollar amount.
