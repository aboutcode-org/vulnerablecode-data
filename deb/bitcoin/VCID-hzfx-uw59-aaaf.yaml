severities: []
summary: The CTransaction::FetchInputs method in bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before 0.8.0rc1
  copies transactions from disk to memory without incrementally checking for spent
  prevouts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disk I/O consumption)
  via a Bitcoin transaction with many inputs corresponding to many different parts
  of the stored block chain.
