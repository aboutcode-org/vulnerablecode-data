summary: bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before 0.4.9rc2, 0.5.x before 0.5.8rc2, 0.6.x before
  0.6.5rc2, and 0.7.x before 0.7.3rc2, and wxBitcoin, do not properly consider whether
  a block's size could require an excessive number of database locks, which allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (split) and enable certain double-spending
  capabilities via a large block that triggers incorrect Berkeley DB locking.
