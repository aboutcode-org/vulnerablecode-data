severities: []
summary: The CivetWeb web library does not validate uploaded filepaths when running
  on an OS other than Windows, when using the built-in HTTP form-based file upload
  mechanism, via the mg_handle_form_request API. Web applications that use the file
  upload form handler, and use parts of the user-controlled filename in the output
  path, are susceptible to directory traversal
