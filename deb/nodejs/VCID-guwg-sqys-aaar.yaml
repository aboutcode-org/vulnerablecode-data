severities: []
summary: Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 are vulnerable
  to a use-after-free bug in its TLS implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled
  socket, node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly allocated
  WriteWrap object as first argument. If the DoWrite method does not return an error,
  this object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure.
  This may be exploited to corrupt memory leading to a Denial of Service or potentially
  other exploits.
