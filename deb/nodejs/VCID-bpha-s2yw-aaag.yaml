summary: "Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to DNS\
  \ rebinding attacks as the whitelist includes \u201Clocalhost6\u201D. When \u201C\
  localhost6\u201D is not present in /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary domain that\
  \ is resolved via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker controls the victim's\
  \ DNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS rebinding protection can be bypassed\
  \ by using the \u201Clocalhost6\u201D domain. As long as the attacker uses the \u201C\
  localhost6\u201D domain, they can still apply the attack described in CVE-2018-7160."
