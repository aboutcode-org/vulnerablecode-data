summary: In Node.js including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2,
  and 11.x before 11.10.1, an attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by establishing
  an HTTP or HTTPS connection in keep-alive mode and by sending headers very slowly.
  This keeps the connection and associated resources alive for a long period of time.
  Potential attacks are mitigated by the use of a load balancer or other proxy layer.
  This vulnerability is an extension of CVE-2018-12121, addressed in November and
  impacts all active Node.js release lines including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before
  8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and 11.x before 11.10.1.
