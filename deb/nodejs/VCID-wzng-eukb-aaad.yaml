summary: In all versions of Node.js 10 prior to 10.9.0, an argument processing flaw
  can cause `Buffer.alloc()` to return uninitialized memory. This method is intended
  to be safe and only return initialized, or cleared, memory. The third argument specifying
  `encoding` can be passed as a number, this is misinterpreted by `Buffer's` internal
  "fill" method as the `start` to a fill operation. This flaw may be abused where
  `Buffer.alloc()` arguments are derived from user input to return uncleared memory
  blocks that may contain sensitive information.
