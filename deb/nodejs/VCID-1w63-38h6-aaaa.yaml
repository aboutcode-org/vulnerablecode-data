summary: Node.js had a bug in versions 8.X and 9.X which caused buffers to not be
  initialized when the encoding for the fill value did not match the encoding specified.
  For example, 'Buffer.alloc(0x100, "This is not correctly encoded", "hex");' The
  buffer implementation was updated such that the buffer will be initialized to all
  zeros in these cases.
