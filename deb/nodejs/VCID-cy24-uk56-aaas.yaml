summary: The Node.js inspector, in 6.x and later is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding
  attack which could be exploited to perform remote code execution. An attack is possible
  from malicious websites open in a web browser on the same computer, or another computer
  with network access to the computer running the Node.js process. A malicious website
  could use a DNS rebinding attack to trick the web browser to bypass same-origin-policy
  checks and to allow HTTP connections to localhost or to hosts on the local network.
  If a Node.js process with the debug port active is running on localhost or on a
  host on the local network, the malicious website could connect to it as a debugger,
  and get full code execution access.
