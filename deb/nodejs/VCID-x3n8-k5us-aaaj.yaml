severities: []
summary: Node.js < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 converts SANs (Subject
  Alternative Names) to a string format. It uses this string to check peer certificates
  against hostnames when validating connections. The string format was subject to
  an injection vulnerability when name constraints were used within a certificate
  chain, allowing the bypass of these name constraints.Versions of Node.js with the
  fix for this escape SANs containing the problematic characters in order to prevent
  the injection. This behavior can be reverted through the --security-revert command-line
  option.
