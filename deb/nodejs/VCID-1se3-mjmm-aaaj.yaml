severities: []
summary: Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to a
  denial of service attack when too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol'
  are established. This leads to a leak of file descriptors. If a file descriptor
  limit is configured on the system, then the server is unable to accept new connections
  and prevent the process also from opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit
  is configured, then this lead to an excessive memory usage and cause the system
  to run out of memory.
