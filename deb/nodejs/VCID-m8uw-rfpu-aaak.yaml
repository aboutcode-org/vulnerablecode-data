summary: 'Node.js: All versions prior to Node.js 6.15.0: Debugger port 5858 listens
  on any interface by default: When the debugger is enabled with `node --debug` or
  `node debug`, it listens to port 5858 on all interfaces by default. This may allow
  remote computers to attach to the debug port and evaluate arbitrary JavaScript.
  The default interface is now localhost. It has always been possible to start the
  debugger on a specific interface, such as `node --debug=localhost`. The debugger
  was removed in Node.js 8 and replaced with the inspector, so no versions from 8
  and later are vulnerable.'
