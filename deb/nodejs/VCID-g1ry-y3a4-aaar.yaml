summary: 'The HTTP parser in all current versions of Node.js ignores spaces in the
  `Content-Length` header, allowing input such as `Content-Length: 1 2` to be interpreted
  as having a value of `12`. The HTTP specification does not allow for spaces in the
  `Content-Length` value and the Node.js HTTP parser has been brought into line on
  this particular difference. The security risk of this flaw to Node.js users is considered
  to be VERY LOW as it is difficult, and may be impossible, to craft an attack that
  makes use of this flaw in a way that could not already be achieved by supplying
  an incorrect value for `Content-Length`. Vulnerabilities may exist in user-code
  that make incorrect assumptions about the potential accuracy of this value compared
  to the actual length of the data supplied. Node.js users crafting lower-level HTTP
  utilities are advised to re-check the length of any input supplied after parsing
  is complete.'
