severities: []
summary: Node.js < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 did not handle multi-value
  Relative Distinguished Names correctly. Attackers could craft certificate subjects
  containing a single-value Relative Distinguished Name that would be interpreted
  as a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, for example, in order to inject a
  Common Name that would allow bypassing the certificate subject verification.Affected
  versions of Node.js that do not accept multi-value Relative Distinguished Names
  and are thus not vulnerable to such attacks themselves. However, third-party code
  that uses node's ambiguous presentation of certificate subjects may be vulnerable.
