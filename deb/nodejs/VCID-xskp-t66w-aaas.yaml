severities: []
summary: Node.js versions 9.7.0 and later and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity
  is MEDIUM. A bug introduced in 9.7.0 increases the memory consumed when reading
  from the network into JavaScript using the net.Socket object directly as a stream.
  An attacker could use this cause a denial of service by sending tiny chunks of data
  in short succession. This vulnerability was restored by reverting to the prior behaviour.
