summary: An issue was discovered in KDE Partition Manager 4.1.0 before 4.2.0. The
  kpmcore_externalcommand helper contains a logic flaw in which the service invoking
  D-Bus is not properly checked. An attacker on the local machine can replace /etc/fstab,
  and execute mount and other partitioning related commands, while KDE Partition Manager
  is running. the mount command can then be used to gain full root privileges.
