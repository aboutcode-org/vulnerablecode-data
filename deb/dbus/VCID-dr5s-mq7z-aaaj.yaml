summary: The dbus-daemon in D-Bus 1.2.x through 1.4.x, 1.6.x before 1.6.20, and 1.8.x
  before 1.8.4, sends an AccessDenied error to the service instead of a client when
  the client is prohibited from accessing the service, which allows local users to
  cause a denial of service (initialization failure and exit) or possibly conduct
  a side-channel attack via a D-Bus message to an inactive service.
