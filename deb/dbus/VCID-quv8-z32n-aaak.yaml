summary: An issue was discovered in dbus >= 1.3.0 before 1.12.18. The DBusServer in
  libdbus, as used in dbus-daemon, leaks file descriptors when a message exceeds the
  per-message file descriptor limit. A local attacker with access to the D-Bus system
  bus or another system service's private AF_UNIX socket could use this to make the
  system service reach its file descriptor limit, denying service to subsequent D-Bus
  clients.
