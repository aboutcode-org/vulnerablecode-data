severities: []
summary: dbus before 1.10.28, 1.12.x before 1.12.16, and 1.13.x before 1.13.12, as
  used in DBusServer in Canonical Upstart in Ubuntu 14.04 (and in some, less common,
  uses of dbus-daemon), allows cookie spoofing because of symlink mishandling in the
  reference implementation of DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 in the libdbus library. (This only
  affects the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism.) A malicious client with
  write access to its own home directory could manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings symlink
  to cause a DBusServer with a different uid to read and write in unintended locations.
  In the worst case, this could result in the DBusServer reusing a cookie that is
  known to the malicious client, and treating that cookie as evidence that a subsequent
  client connection came from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authentication bypass.
