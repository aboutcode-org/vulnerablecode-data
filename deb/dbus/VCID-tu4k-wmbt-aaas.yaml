summary: A use-after-free flaw was found in D-Bus Development branch <= 1.13.16, dbus-1.12.x
  stable branch <= 1.12.18, and dbus-1.10.x and older branches <= 1.10.30 when a system
  has multiple usernames sharing the same UID. When a set of policy rules references
  these usernames, D-Bus may free some memory in the heap, which is still used by
  data structures necessary for the other usernames sharing the UID, possibly leading
  to a crash or other undefined behaviors
