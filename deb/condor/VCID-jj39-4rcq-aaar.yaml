summary: Multiple format string vulnerabilities in Condor 7.2.0 through 7.6.4, and
  possibly certain 7.7.x versions, as used in Red Hat MRG Grid and possibly other
  products, allow local users to cause a denial of service (condor_schedd daemon and
  failure to launch jobs) and possibly execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers
  in (1) the reason for a hold for a job that uses an XML user log, (2) the filename
  of a file to be transferred, and possibly other unspecified vectors.
