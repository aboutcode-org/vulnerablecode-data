severities: []
summary: The vino_server_client_data_pending function in vino-server.c in GNOME Vino
  2.26.1, 2.32.1, 3.7.3, and earlier, and 3.8 when encryption is disabled, does not
  properly clear client data when an error causes the connection to close during authentication,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop, CPU and
  disk consumption) via multiple crafted requests during authentication.
