summary: The do_item_get function in items.c in memcached 1.4.4 and other versions
  before 1.4.17, when running in verbose mode, allows remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service (segmentation fault) via a request to delete a key, which does
  not account for the lack of a null terminator in the key and triggers a buffer over-read
  when printing to stderr, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-0179.
