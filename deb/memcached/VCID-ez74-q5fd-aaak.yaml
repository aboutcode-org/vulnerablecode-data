severities: []
summary: The process_bin_delete function in memcached.c in memcached 1.4.4 and other
  versions before 1.4.17, when running in verbose mode, allows remote attackers to
  cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a request to delete a key, which
  does not account for the lack of a null terminator in the key and triggers a buffer
  over-read when printing to stderr.
