summary: snapd 2.54.2 fails to perform sufficient validation of snap content interface
  and layout paths, resulting in the ability for snaps to inject arbitrary AppArmor
  policy rules via malformed content interface and layout declarations and hence escape
  strict snap confinement. Fixed in snapd versions 2.54.3+18.04, 2.54.3+20.04 and
  2.54.3+21.10.1
