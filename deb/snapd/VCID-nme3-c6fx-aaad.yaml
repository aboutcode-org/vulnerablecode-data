summary: It was discovered that snapctl user-open allowed altering the $XDG_DATA_DIRS
  environment variable when calling the system xdg-open. OpenURL() in usersession/userd/launcher.go
  would alter $XDG_DATA_DIRS to append a path to a directory controlled by the calling
  snap. A malicious snap could exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions
  to control how the host system xdg-open script opens the URL and, for example, execute
  a script shipped with the snap without confinement. This issue did not affect Ubuntu
  Core systems. Fixed in snapd versions 2.45.1ubuntu0.2, 2.45.1+18.04.2 and 2.45.1+20.04.2.
