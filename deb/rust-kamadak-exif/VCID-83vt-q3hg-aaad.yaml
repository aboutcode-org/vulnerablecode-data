summary: kamadak-exif is an exif parsing library written in pure Rust. In kamadak-exif
  version 0.5.2, there is an infinite loop in parsing crafted PNG files. Specifically,
  reader::read_from_container can cause an infinite loop when a crafted PNG file is
  given. This is fixed in version 0.5.3. No workaround is available. Applications
  that do not pass files with the PNG signature to Reader::read_from_container are
  not affected.
