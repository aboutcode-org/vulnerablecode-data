summary: A flaw was found in the VirGL virtual OpenGL renderer (virglrenderer). The
  virgl did not properly initialize memory when allocating a host-backed memory resource.
  A malicious guest could use this flaw to mmap from the guest kernel and read this
  uninitialized memory from the host, possibly leading to information disclosure.
