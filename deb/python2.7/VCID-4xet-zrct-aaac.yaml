summary: There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An attacker who
  controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client (such as web browser) connects
  to, could trigger a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication
  request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the server to the client.
  The greatest threat that this flaw poses is to application availability.
