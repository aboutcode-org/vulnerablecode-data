severities: []
summary: The asyncore module in Python before 3.2 does not properly handle unsuccessful
  calls to the accept function, and does not have accompanying documentation describing
  how daemon applications should handle unsuccessful calls to the accept function,
  which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct denial of service attacks
  that terminate these applications via network connections.
