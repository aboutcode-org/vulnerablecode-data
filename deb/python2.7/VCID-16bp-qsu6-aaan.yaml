summary: In Python (aka CPython) up to 3.10.8, the mailcap module does not add escape
  characters into commands discovered in the system mailcap file. This may allow attackers
  to inject shell commands into applications that call mailcap.findmatch with untrusted
  input (if they lack validation of user-provided filenames or arguments). The fix
  is also back-ported to 3.7, 3.8, 3.9
