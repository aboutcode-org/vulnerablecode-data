summary: 'In Python 3.6 through 3.6.10, 3.7 through 3.7.8, 3.8 through 3.8.4rc1, and
  3.9 through 3.9.0b4 on Windows, a Trojan horse python3.dll might be used in cases
  where CPython is embedded in a native application. This occurs because python3X.dll
  may use an invalid search path for python3.dll loading (after Py_SetPath has been
  used). NOTE: this issue CANNOT occur when using python.exe from a standard (non-embedded)
  Python installation on Windows.'
