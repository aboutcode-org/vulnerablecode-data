summary: The CGIHTTPServer module in Python 2.7.5 and 3.3.4 does not properly handle
  URLs in which URL encoding is used for path separators, which allows remote attackers
  to read script source code or conduct directory traversal attacks and execute unintended
  code via a crafted character sequence, as demonstrated by a %2f separator.
