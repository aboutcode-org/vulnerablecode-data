summary: 'The urllib and urllib2 modules in Python 2.x before 2.7.2 and 3.x before
  3.2.1 process Location headers that specify redirection to file: URLs, which makes
  it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial
  of service (resource consumption) via a crafted URL, as demonstrated by the file:///etc/passwd
  and file:///dev/zero URLs.'
