summary: 'An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.17 and urllib
  in Python 3.x through 3.8.0. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls
  a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen
  with \r\n (specifically in the host component of a URL) followed by an HTTP header.
  This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query string issue and the CVE-2019-9947 path
  string issue. (This is not exploitable when glibc has CVE-2016-10739 fixed.). This
  is fixed in: v2.7.18, v2.7.18rc1; v3.5.10, v3.5.10rc1; v3.6.11, v3.6.11rc1, v3.6.12;
  v3.7.8, v3.7.8rc1, v3.7.9; v3.8.3, v3.8.3rc1, v3.8.4, v3.8.4rc1, v3.8.5, v3.8.6,
  v3.8.6rc1.'
