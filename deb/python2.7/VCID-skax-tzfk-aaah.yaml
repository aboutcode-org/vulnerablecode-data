summary: Python's elementtree C accelerator failed to initialise Expat's hash salt
  during initialization. This could make it easy to conduct denial of service attacks
  against Expat by constructing an XML document that would cause pathological hash
  collisions in Expat's internal data structures, consuming large amounts CPU and
  RAM. The vulnerability exists in Python versions 3.7.0, 3.6.0 through 3.6.6, 3.5.0
  through 3.5.6, 3.4.0 through 3.4.9, 2.7.0 through 2.7.15.
