severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Python through 2.7.16, 3.x through 3.5.7, 3.6.x
  through 3.6.9, and 3.7.x through 3.7.4. The email module wrongly parses email addresses
  that contain multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module and
  implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message could be tricked
  into accepting an email address that should be denied. An attack may be the same
  as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.
