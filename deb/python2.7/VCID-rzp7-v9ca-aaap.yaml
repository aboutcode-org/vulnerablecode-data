summary: Python before 2.6.8, 2.7.x before 2.7.3, 3.x before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before
  3.2.3 computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions
  predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
  (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.
