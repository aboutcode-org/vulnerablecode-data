summary: Python 3.x through 3.9.1 has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c,
  which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python applications that accept
  floating-point numbers as untrusted input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to
  c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.
