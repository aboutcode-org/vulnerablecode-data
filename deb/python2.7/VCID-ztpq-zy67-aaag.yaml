severities: []
summary: The ssl.match_hostname function in the SSL module in Python 2.6 through 3.4
  does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative
  Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
  spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification
  Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
