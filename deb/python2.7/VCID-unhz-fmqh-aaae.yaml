summary: The HTTP clients in the (1) httplib, (2) urllib, (3) urllib2, and (4) xmlrpclib
  libraries in CPython (aka Python) 2.x before 2.7.9 and 3.x before 3.4.3, when accessing
  an HTTPS URL, do not (a) check the certificate against a trust store or verify that
  the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's (b) Common Name or (c)
  subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers
  to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
