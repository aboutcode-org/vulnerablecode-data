severities: []
summary: The audioop module in Python 2.7 and 3.2 does not verify the relationships
  between size arguments and byte string lengths, which allows context-dependent attackers
  to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via crafted
  arguments, as demonstrated by a call to audioop.reverse with a one-byte string,
  a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-1634.
