severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in amqp_handle_input in amqp_connection.c in rabbitmq-c
  0.9.0. There is an integer overflow that leads to heap memory corruption in the
  handling of CONNECTION_STATE_HEADER. A rogue server could return a malicious frame
  header that leads to a smaller target_size value than needed. This condition is
  then carried on to a memcpy function that copies too much data into a heap buffer.
