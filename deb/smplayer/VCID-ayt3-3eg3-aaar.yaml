summary: An exploitable arbitrary memory read vulnerability exists in the MQTT packet-parsing
  functionality of Cesanta Mongoose 6.13. It is a heap-based buffer over-read in mg_mqtt_next_subscribe_topic.
  A specially crafted MQTT SUBSCRIBE packet can cause an arbitrary out-of-bounds memory
  read potentially resulting in information disclosure and denial of service. An attacker
  needs to send a specially crafted MQTT packet over the network to trigger this vulnerability.
