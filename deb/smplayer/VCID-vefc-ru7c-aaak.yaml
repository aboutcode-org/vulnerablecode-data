summary: An exploitable memory corruption vulnerability exists in the Websocket protocol
  implementation of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. A specially crafted websocket packet can
  cause a buffer to be allocated while leaving stale pointers which leads to a use-after-free
  vulnerability which can be exploited to achieve remote code execution. An attacker
  needs to send a specially crafted websocket packet over the network to trigger this
  vulnerability.
