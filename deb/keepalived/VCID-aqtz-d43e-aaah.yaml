summary: keepalived 2.0.8 didn't check for existing plain files when writing data
  to a temporary file upon a call to PrintData or PrintStats. If a local attacker
  had previously created a file with the expected name (e.g., /tmp/keepalived.data
  or /tmp/keepalived.stats), with read access for the attacker and write access for
  the keepalived process, then this potentially leaked sensitive information.
