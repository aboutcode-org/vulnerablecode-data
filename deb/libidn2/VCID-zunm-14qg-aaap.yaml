summary: GNU libidn2 before 2.2.0 fails to perform the roundtrip checks specified
  in RFC3490 Section 4.2 when converting A-labels to U-labels. This makes it possible
  in some circumstances for one domain to impersonate another. By creating a malicious
  domain that matches a target domain except for the inclusion of certain punycoded
  Unicode characters (that would be discarded when converted first to a Unicode label
  and then back to an ASCII label), arbitrary domains can be impersonated.
