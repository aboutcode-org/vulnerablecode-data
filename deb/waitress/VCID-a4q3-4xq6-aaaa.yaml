summary: 'Waitress version 1.4.2 allows a DOS attack When waitress receives a header
  that contains invalid characters. When a header like "Bad-header: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\x10"
  is received, it will cause the regular expression engine to catastrophically backtrack
  causing the process to use 100% CPU time and blocking any other interactions. This
  allows an attacker to send a single request with an invalid header and take the
  service offline. This issue was introduced in version 1.4.2 when the regular expression
  was updated to attempt to match the behaviour required by errata associated with
  RFC7230. The regular expression that is used to validate incoming headers has been
  updated in version 1.4.3, it is recommended that people upgrade to the new version
  of Waitress as soon as possible.'
