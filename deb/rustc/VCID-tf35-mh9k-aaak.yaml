summary: '** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Bidirectional Algorithm in
  the Unicode Specification through 14.0. It permits the visual reordering of characters
  via control sequences, which can be used to craft source code that renders different
  logic than the logical ordering of tokens ingested by compilers and interpreters.
  Adversaries can leverage this to encode source code for compilers accepting Unicode
  such that targeted vulnerabilities are introduced invisibly to human reviewers.
  NOTE: the Unicode Consortium offers the following alternative approach to presenting
  this concern. An issue is noted in the nature of international text that can affect
  applications that implement support for The Unicode Standard and the Unicode Bidirectional
  Algorithm (all versions). Due to text display behavior when text includes left-to-right
  and right-to-left characters, the visual order of tokens may be different from their
  logical order. Additionally, control characters needed to fully support the requirements
  of bidirectional text can further obfuscate the logical order of tokens. Unless
  mitigated, an adversary could craft source code such that the ordering of tokens
  perceived by human reviewers does not match what will be processed by a compiler/interpreter/etc.
  The Unicode Consortium has documented this class of vulnerability in its document,
  Unicode Technical Report #36, Unicode Security Considerations. The Unicode Consortium
  also provides guidance on mitigations for this class of issues in Unicode Technical
  Standard #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms, and in Unicode Standard Annex #31, Unicode
  Identifier and Pattern Syntax. Also, the BIDI specification allows applications
  to tailor the implementation in ways that can mitigate misleading visual reordering
  in program text; see HL4 in Unicode Standard Annex #9, Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.'
