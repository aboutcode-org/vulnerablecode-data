severities: []
summary: In the standard library in Rust before 1.52.0, the Zip implementation calls
  __iterator_get_unchecked() more than once for the same index (under certain conditions)
  when next_back() and next() are used together. This bug could lead to a memory safety
  violation due to an unmet safety requirement for the TrustedRandomAccess trait.
