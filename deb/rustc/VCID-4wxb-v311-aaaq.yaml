severities: []
summary: In the standard library in Rust before 1.49.0, String::retain() function
  has a panic safety problem. It allows creation of a non-UTF-8 Rust string when the
  provided closure panics. This bug could result in a memory safety violation when
  other string APIs assume that UTF-8 encoding is used on the same string.
