summary: The Rust Programming Language Standard Library 1.34.x before 1.34.2 contains
  a stabilized method which, if overridden, can violate Rust's safety guarantees and
  cause memory unsafety. If the `Error::type_id` method is overridden then any type
  can be safely cast to any other type, causing memory safety vulnerabilities in safe
  code (e.g., out-of-bounds write or read). Code that does not manually implement
  Error::type_id is unaffected.
