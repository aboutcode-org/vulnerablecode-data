summary: The tokenizer in QPDF 6.0.0 and 7.0.b1 is recursive for arrays and dictionaries,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and
  segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a PDF document
  with a deep data structure, as demonstrated by a crash in QPDFObjectHandle::parseInternal
  in libqpdf/QPDFObjectHandle.cc.
