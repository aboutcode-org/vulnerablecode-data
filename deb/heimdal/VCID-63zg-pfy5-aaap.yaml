severities: []
summary: In Heimdal through 7.4, remote unauthenticated attackers are able to crash
  the KDC by sending a crafted UDP packet containing empty data fields for client
  name or realm. The parser would unconditionally dereference NULL pointers in that
  case, leading to a segmentation fault. This is related to the _kdc_as_rep function
  in kdc/kerberos5.c and the der_length_visible_string function in lib/asn1/der_length.c.
