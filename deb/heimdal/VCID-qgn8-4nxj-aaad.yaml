severities: []
summary: 'Heimdal before 7.4 allows remote attackers to impersonate services with
  Orpheus'' Lyre attacks because it obtains service-principal names in a way that
  violates the Kerberos 5 protocol specification. In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP
  service name must be obtained from the encrypted version stored in ''enc_part''
  instead of the unencrypted version stored in ''ticket''. Use of the unencrypted
  version provides an opportunity for successful server impersonation and other attacks.
  NOTE: this CVE is only for Heimdal and other products that embed Heimdal code; it
  does not apply to other instances in which this part of the Kerberos 5 protocol
  specification is violated.'
