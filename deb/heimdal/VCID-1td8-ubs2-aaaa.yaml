severities: []
summary: All Samba versions 4.x.x before 4.9.17, 4.10.x before 4.10.11 and 4.11.x
  before 4.11.3 have an issue, where the S4U (MS-SFU) Kerberos delegation model includes
  a feature allowing for a subset of clients to be opted out of constrained delegation
  in any way, either S4U2Self or regular Kerberos authentication, by forcing all tickets
  for these clients to be non-forwardable. In AD this is implemented by a user attribute
  delegation_not_allowed (aka not-delegated), which translates to disallow-forwardable.
  However the Samba AD DC does not do that for S4U2Self and does set the forwardable
  flag even if the impersonated client has the not-delegated flag set.
