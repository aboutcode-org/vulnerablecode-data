severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Varnish HTTP Cache 4.0.1 through 4.0.4, 4.1.0
  through 4.1.7, 5.0.0, and 5.1.0 through 5.1.2. A wrong if statement in the varnishd
  source code means that particular invalid requests from the client can trigger an
  assert, related to an Integer Overflow. This causes the varnishd worker process
  to abort and restart, losing the cached contents in the process. An attacker can
  therefore crash the varnishd worker process on demand and effectively keep it from
  serving content - a Denial-of-Service attack. The specific source-code filename
  containing the incorrect statement varies across releases.
