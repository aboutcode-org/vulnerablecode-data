severities: []
summary: '** DISPUTED ** The Command Line Interface (aka Server CLI or administration
  interface) in the master process in the reverse proxy server in Varnish before 2.1.0
  does not require authentication for commands received through a TCP port, which
  allows remote attackers to (1) execute arbitrary code via a vcl.inline directive
  that provides a VCL configuration file containing inline C code; (2) change the
  ownership of the master process via param.set, stop, and start directives; (3) read
  the initial line of an arbitrary file via a vcl.load directive; or (4) conduct cross-site
  request forgery (CSRF) attacks that leverage a victim''s location on a trusted network
  and improper input validation of directives.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this report,
  saying that it is "fundamentally misguided and pointless."'
