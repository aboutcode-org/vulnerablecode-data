severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Varnish Cache before 6.0.4 LTS, and 6.1.x and
  6.2.x before 6.2.1. An HTTP/1 parsing failure allows a remote attacker to trigger
  an assert by sending crafted HTTP/1 requests. The assert will cause an automatic
  restart with a clean cache, which makes it a Denial of Service attack.
