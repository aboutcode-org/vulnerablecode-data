severities: []
summary: It was discovered that the zebra daemon in Quagga before 1.0.20161017 suffered
  from a stack-based buffer overflow when processing IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages.
  The root cause was relying on BUFSIZ to be compatible with a message size; however,
  BUFSIZ is system-dependent.
