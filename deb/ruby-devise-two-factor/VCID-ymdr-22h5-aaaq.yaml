summary: Tinfoil Devise-two-factor before 2.0.0 does not strictly follow section 5.2
  of RFC 6238 and does not "burn" a successfully validated one-time password (aka
  OTP), which allows remote or physically proximate attackers with a target user's
  login credentials to log in as said user by obtaining the OTP through performing
  a man-in-the-middle attack between the provider and verifier, or shoulder surfing,
  and replaying the OTP in the current time-step.
