summary: The default configuration of logrotate on Gentoo Linux uses root privileges
  to process files in directories that permit non-root write access, which allows
  local users to conduct symlink and hard link attacks by leveraging logrotate's lack
  of support for untrusted directories, as demonstrated by directories under /var/log/
  for packages.
