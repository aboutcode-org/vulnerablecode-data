summary: The default configuration of logrotate on SUSE openSUSE Factory uses root
  privileges to process files in directories that permit non-root write access, which
  allows local users to conduct symlink and hard link attacks by leveraging logrotate's
  lack of support for untrusted directories, as demonstrated by directories for the
  (1) cobbler, (2) inn, (3) safte-monitor, and (4) uucp packages.
