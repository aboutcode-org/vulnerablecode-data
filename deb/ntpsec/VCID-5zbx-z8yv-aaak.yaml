summary: ntpkeygen can generate keys that ntpd fails to parse. NTPsec 1.2.0 allows
  ntpkeygen to generate keys with '#' characters. ntpd then either pads, shortens
  the key, or fails to load these keys entirely, depending on the key type and the
  placement of the '#'. This results in the administrator not being able to use the
  keys as expected or the keys are shorter than expected and easier to brute-force,
  possibly resulting in MITM attacks between ntp clients and ntp servers. For short
  AES128 keys, ntpd generates a warning that it is padding them.
