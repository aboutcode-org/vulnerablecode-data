severities: []
summary: The WriteOnePNGImage function in coders/png.c in GraphicsMagick 1.3.26 allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application
  crash) via a crafted file, because the program's actual control flow was inconsistent
  with its indentation. This resulted in a logging statement executing outside of
  a loop, and consequently using an invalid array index corresponding to the loop's
  exit condition.
