summary: An issue was discovered in SoX 14.4.2. In xmalloc.h, there is an integer
  overflow on the result of multiplication fed into the lsx_valloc macro that wraps
  malloc. When the buffer is allocated, it is smaller than expected, leading to a
  heap-based buffer overflow in channels_start in remix.c.
