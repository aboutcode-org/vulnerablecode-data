summary: An issue was discovered in ezXML 0.8.3 through 0.8.6. The function ezxml_decode,
  while parsing a crafted XML file, performs incorrect memory handling, leading to
  a heap-based buffer over-read while running strchr() starting with a pointer after
  a '\0' character (where the processing of a string was finished).
