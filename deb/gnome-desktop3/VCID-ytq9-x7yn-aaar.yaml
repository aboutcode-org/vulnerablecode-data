severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in GNOME gnome-desktop 3.26, 3.28, and 3.30 prior
  to 3.30.2.2, and 3.32 prior to 3.32.1.1. A compromised thumbnailer may escape the
  bubblewrap sandbox used to confine thumbnailers by using the TIOCSTI ioctl to push
  characters into the input buffer of the thumbnailer's controlling terminal, allowing
  an attacker to escape the sandbox if the thumbnailer has a controlling terminal.
  This is due to improper filtering of the TIOCSTI ioctl on 64-bit systems, similar
  to CVE-2019-10063.
