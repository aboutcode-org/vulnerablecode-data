summary: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A vulnerability involving
  out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow exists starting with
  version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems,
  Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflow that can potentially be
  exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code
  execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len`
  configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted
  commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled
  as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for
  this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the
  `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len`
  configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users
  from using the CONFIG SET command.
