summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An integer
  overflow bug in the underlying string library can be used to corrupt the heap and
  potentially result with denial of service or remote code execution. The vulnerability
  involves changing the default proto-max-bulk-len configuration parameter to a very
  large value and constructing specially crafted network payloads or commands. The
  problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An additional workaround
  to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent
  users from modifying the proto-max-bulk-len configuration parameter. This can be
  done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.
