summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In affected
  versions an integer overflow bug in Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and
  potentially result with remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing
  the default proto-max-bulk-len and client-query-buffer-limit configuration parameters
  to very large values and constructing specially crafted very large stream elements.
  The problem is fixed in Redis 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. For users unable to upgrade
  an additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server
  executable is to prevent users from modifying the proto-max-bulk-len configuration
  parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using
  the CONFIG SET command.
