summary: Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used
  as a database, cache, and message broker. An integer overflow bug in Redis 6.2 before
  6.2.3 could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote
  code execution. Redis 6.0 and earlier are not directly affected by this issue. The
  problem is fixed in version 6.2.3. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem
  without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying
  the `set-max-intset-entries` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL
  to restrict unprivileged users from using the `CONFIG SET` command.
