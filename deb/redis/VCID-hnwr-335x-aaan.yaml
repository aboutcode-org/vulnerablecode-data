summary: A buffer overflow in Redis 3.2.x prior to 3.2.4 causes arbitrary code execution
  when a crafted command is sent. An out of bounds write vulnerability exists in the
  handling of the client-output-buffer-limit option during the CONFIG SET command
  for the Redis data structure store. A crafted CONFIG SET command can lead to an
  out of bounds write potentially resulting in code execution.
