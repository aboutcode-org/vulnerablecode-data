summary: When loading the shared library that provides the OTR protocol implementation,
  Thunderbird will initially attempt to open it using a filename that isn't distributed
  by Thunderbird. If a computer has already been infected with a malicious library
  of the alternative filename, and the malicious library has been copied to a directory
  that is contained in the search path for executable libraries, then Thunderbird
  will load the incorrect library. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.
