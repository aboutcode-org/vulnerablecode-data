summary: Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 78.13.0.
  Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with
  enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
  vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.1 and Firefox ESR < 91.1.
