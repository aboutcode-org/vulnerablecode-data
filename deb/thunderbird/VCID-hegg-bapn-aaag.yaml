summary: OpenPGP secret keys that were imported using Thunderbird version 78.8.1 up
  to version 78.10.1 were stored unencrypted on the user's local disk. The master
  password protection was inactive for those keys. Version 78.10.2 will restore the
  protection mechanism for newly imported keys, and will automatically protect keys
  that had been imported using affected Thunderbird versions. This vulnerability affects
  Thunderbird < 78.10.2.
