summary: If Thunderbird was configured to use STARTTLS for an IMAP connection, and
  an attacker injected IMAP server responses prior to the completion of the STARTTLS
  handshake, then Thunderbird didn't ignore the injected data. This could have resulted
  in Thunderbird showing incorrect information, for example the attacker could have
  tricked Thunderbird to show folders that didn't exist on the IMAP server. This vulnerability
  affects Thunderbird < 78.12.
