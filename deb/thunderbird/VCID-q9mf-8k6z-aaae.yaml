summary: A crafted S/MIME message consisting of an inner encryption layer and an outer
  SignedData layer was shown as having a valid digital signature, although the signer
  might have had no access to the contents of the encrypted message, and might have
  stripped a different signature from the encrypted message. Previous versions had
  only suppressed showing a digital signature for messages with an outer multipart/signed
  layer. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.1.1.
