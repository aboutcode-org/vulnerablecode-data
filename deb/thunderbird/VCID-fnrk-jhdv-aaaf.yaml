summary: Thunderbird ignored the configuration to require STARTTLS security for an
  SMTP connection. A MITM could perform a downgrade attack to intercept transmitted
  messages, or could take control of the authenticated session to execute SMTP commands
  chosen by the MITM. If an unprotected authentication method was configured, the
  MITM could obtain the authentication credentials, too. This vulnerability affects
  Thunderbird < 91.2.
