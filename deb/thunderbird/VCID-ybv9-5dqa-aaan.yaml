summary: An attacker may perform a DoS attack to prevent a user from sending encrypted
  email to a correspondent. If an attacker creates a crafted OpenPGP key with a subkey
  that has an invalid self signature, and the Thunderbird user imports the crafted
  key, then Thunderbird may try to use the invalid subkey, but the RNP library rejects
  it from being used, causing encryption to fail. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird
  < 78.9.1.
