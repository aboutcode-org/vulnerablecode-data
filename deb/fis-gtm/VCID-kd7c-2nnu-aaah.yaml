summary: An issue was discovered in YottaDB through r1.32 and V7.0-000 and FIS GT.M
  through V7.0-000. Using crafted input, an attacker can cause a call to $Extract
  to force an signed integer holding the size of a buffer to take on a large negative
  number, which is then used as the length of a memcpy call that occurs on the stack,
  causing a buffer overflow.
