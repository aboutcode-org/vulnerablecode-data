summary: The C client and C-based client bindings in the Apache Qpid Proton library
  before 0.13.1 on Windows do not properly verify that the server hostname matches
  a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509
  certificate when using the SChannel-based security layer, which allows man-in-the-middle
  attackers to spoof servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
