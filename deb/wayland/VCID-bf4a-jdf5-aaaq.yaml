summary: An internal reference count is held on the buffer pool, incremented every
  time a new buffer is created from the pool. The reference count is maintained as
  an int; on LP64 systems this can cause the reference count to overflow if the client
  creates a large number of wl_shm buffer objects, or if it can coerce the server
  to create a large number of external references to the buffer storage. With the
  reference count overflowing, a use-after-free can be constructed on the wl_shm_pool
  tracking structure, where values may be incremented or decremented; it may also
  be possible to construct a limited oracle to leak 4 bytes of server-side memory
  to the attacking client at a time.
