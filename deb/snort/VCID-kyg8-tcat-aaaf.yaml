severities: []
summary: A vulnerability in Server Name Identification (SNI) request filtering of
  Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and the
  Snort detection engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass
  filtering technology on an affected device and exfiltrate data from a compromised
  host. This vulnerability is due to inadequate filtering of the SSL handshake. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using data from the SSL client hello
  packet to communicate with an external server. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to execute a command-and-control attack on a compromised host and perform
  additional data exfiltration attacks.
