severities: []
summary: Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the way the Snort
  detection engine processes ICMP traffic that could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The
  vulnerability is due to improper memory resource management while the Snort detection
  engine is processing ICMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a series of ICMP packets through an affected device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to exhaust resources on the affected device, causing the
  device to reload.
