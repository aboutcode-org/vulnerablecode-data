severities: []
summary: Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort detection
  engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the configured
  file policies on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to errors in how the
  Snort detection engine handles specific HTTP responses. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets that would flow through an affected
  system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the configured file
  policies and deliver a malicious payload to the protected network.
