summary: Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort detection
  engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured
  File Policy for HTTP. The vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of modified
  HTTP packets used in chunked responses. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending crafted HTTP packets through an affected device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to bypass a configured File Policy for HTTP packets and
  deliver a malicious payload.
