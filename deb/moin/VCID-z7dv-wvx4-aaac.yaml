severities: []
summary: 'Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in MoinMoin 1.5.8 and
  earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) certain
  input processed by formatter/text_gedit.py (aka the gui editor formatter); (2) a
  page name, which triggers an injection in PageEditor.py when the page is successfully
  deleted by a victim in a DeletePage action; or (3) the destination page name for
  a RenamePage action, which triggers an injection in PageEditor.py when a victim''s
  rename attempt fails because of a duplicate name.  NOTE: the AttachFile XSS issue
  is already covered by CVE-2008-0781, and the login XSS issue is already covered
  by CVE-2008-0780.'
