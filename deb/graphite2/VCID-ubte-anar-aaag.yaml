summary: The directrun function in directmachine.cpp in Libgraphite in Graphite 2
  1.2.4, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.6.1,
  does not validate a certain skip operation, which allows remote attackers to execute

  read and application crash) via a crafted Graphite smart font.
