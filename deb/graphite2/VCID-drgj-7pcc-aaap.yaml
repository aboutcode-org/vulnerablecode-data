summary: Code.cpp in Libgraphite in Graphite 2 1.2.4, as used in Mozilla Firefox before
  43.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.6.1, does not consider recursive load calls
  during a size check, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted Graphite
  smart font.
