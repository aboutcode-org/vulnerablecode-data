summary: 'ModSecurity 3.x through 3.0.5 mishandles excessively nested JSON objects.
  Crafted JSON objects with nesting tens-of-thousands deep could result in the web
  server being unable to service legitimate requests. Even a moderately large (e.g.,
  300KB) HTTP request can occupy one of the limited NGINX worker processes for minutes
  and consume almost all of the available CPU on the machine. Modsecurity 2 is similarly
  vulnerable: the affected versions include 2.8.0 through 2.9.4.'
