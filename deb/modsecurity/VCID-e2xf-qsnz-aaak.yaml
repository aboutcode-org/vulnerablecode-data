summary: '** DISPUTED ** Trustwave ModSecurity 3.x through 3.0.4 allows denial of
  service via a special request. NOTE: The discoverer reports "Trustwave has signaled
  they are disputing our claims." The CVE suggests that there is a security issue
  with how ModSecurity handles regular expressions that can result in a Denial of
  Service condition. The vendor does not consider this as a security issue because1)
  there is no default configuration issue here. An attacker would need to know that
  a rule using a potentially problematic regular expression was in place, 2) the attacker
  would need to know the basic nature of the regular expression itself to exploit
  any resource issues. It''s well known that regular expression usage can be taxing
  on system resources regardless of the use case. It is up to the administrator to
  decide on when it is appropriate to trade resources for potential security benefit.'
