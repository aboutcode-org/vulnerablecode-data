summary: A vulnerability in the Portable Executable (PE) file scanning functionality
  of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and prior could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The
  vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input and validation checking mechanisms
  for PE files sent an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending malformed PE files to the device running an affected version ClamAV Software.
  An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read condition, resulting
  in a crash that could result in a denial of service condition on an affected device.
