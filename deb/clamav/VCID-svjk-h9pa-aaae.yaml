severities: []
summary: The ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability
  that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
  (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input
  validation checking mechanisms during certain mail parsing functions (the rfc2047
  function in mbox.c). An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted email to the affected device. This action could cause a buffer
  overflow condition when ClamAV scans the malicious email, allowing the attacker
  to potentially cause a DoS condition on an affected device.
