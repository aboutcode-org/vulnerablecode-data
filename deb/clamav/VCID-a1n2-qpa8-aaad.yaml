summary: 'The Microsoft CHM file parser in ClamAV 0.96.4 and Sophos Anti-Virus 4.61.0
  allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via a crafted reset interval
  in the LZXC header of a CHM file.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs
  if additional information is published showing that the error occurred independently
  in different CHM parser implementations.'
