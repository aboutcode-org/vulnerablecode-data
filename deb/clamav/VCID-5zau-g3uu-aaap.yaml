summary: A vulnerability in the Portable Document Format (PDF) scanning functionality
  of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and prior could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.
  The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data handling mechanisms within the
  device buffer while indexing remaining file data on an affected device. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted PDF files to an affected device.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a heap buffer out-of-bounds
  read condition, resulting in a crash that could result in a denial of service condition
  on an affected device.
