severities: []
summary: The ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability
  that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
  (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input
  validation checking mechanisms during certain mail parsing operations (mbox.c operations
  on bounce messages). If successfully exploited, the ClamAV software could allow
  a variable pointing to the mail body which could cause a used after being free (use-after-free)
  instance which may lead to a disruption of services on an affected device to include
  a denial of service condition.
