summary: A vulnerability in the endpoint software of Cisco AMP for Endpoints and Clam
  AntiVirus could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause the running software
  to delete arbitrary files on the system. The vulnerability is due to a race condition
  that could occur when scanning malicious files. An attacker with local shell access
  could exploit this vulnerability by executing a script that could trigger the race
  condition. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files
  on the system that the attacker would not normally have privileges to delete, producing
  system instability or causing the endpoint software to stop working.
