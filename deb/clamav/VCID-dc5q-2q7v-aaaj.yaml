summary: A vulnerability in the RAR file scanning functionality of Clam AntiVirus
  (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and 0.101.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to a lack of proper error-handling mechanisms when processing nested RAR
  files sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  sending a crafted RAR file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker
  to view or create arbitrary files on the targeted system.
