severities: []
summary: A vulnerability in the email parsing module Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software
  versions 0.102.0, 0.101.4 and prior could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to inefficient MIME parsing routines that result in extremely long scan times
  of specially formatted email files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted email file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the
  attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to scan the crafted email file indefinitely,
  resulting in a denial of service condition.
