severities: []
summary: Integer overflow in ClamAV 0.88.1 and 0.88.4, and other versions before 0.88.5,
  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (scanning service crash) and
  execute arbitrary code via a crafted Portable Executable (PE) file that leads to
  a heap-based buffer overflow when less memory is allocated than expected.
