severities: []
summary: ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability
  that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
  (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input
  validation checking mechanisms of .tar (Tape Archive) files sent to an affected
  device. A successful exploit could cause a checksum buffer over-read condition when
  ClamAV scans the malicious .tar file, potentially allowing the attacker to cause
  a DoS condition on the affected device.
