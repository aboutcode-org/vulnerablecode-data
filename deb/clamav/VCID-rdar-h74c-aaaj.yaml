severities: []
summary: ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability
  that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
  (DoS) condition or potentially execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The
  vulnerability is due to improper input validation checking mechanisms in the message
  parsing function on an affected system. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email to the affected device. This
  action could cause a messageAddArgument (in message.c) buffer overflow condition
  when ClamAV scans the malicious email, allowing the attacker to potentially cause
  a DoS condition or execute arbitrary code on an affected device.
