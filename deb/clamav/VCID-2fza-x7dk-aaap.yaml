summary: ClamAV 0.94.1 and possibly 0.93.1, when Internet Explorer 6 or 7 is used,
  allows remote attackers to bypass detection of malware in an HTML document by placing
  an MZ header (aka "EXE info") at the beginning, and modifying the filename to have
  (1) no extension, (2) a .txt extension, or (3) a .jpg extension, as demonstrated
  by a document containing a CVE-2006-5745 exploit.
