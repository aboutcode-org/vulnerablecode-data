severities: []
summary: ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability
  that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
  (DoS) condition or potentially execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The
  vulnerability is due to improper input validation checking mechanisms in mew packet
  files sent to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause a heap-based
  buffer over-read condition in mew.c when ClamAV scans the malicious file, allowing
  the attacker to cause a DoS condition or potentially execute arbitrary code on the
  affected device.
