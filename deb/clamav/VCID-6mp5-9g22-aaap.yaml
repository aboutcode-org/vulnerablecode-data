summary: 'clamscan in ClamAV before 0.99.4 contains a vulnerability that could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition
  on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation checking
  mechanisms when handling Portable Document Format (.pdf) files sent to an affected
  device. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  sending a crafted .pdf file to an affected device. This action could cause an out-of-bounds
  read when ClamAV scans the malicious file, allowing the attacker to cause a DoS
  condition. This concerns pdf_parse_array and pdf_parse_string in libclamav/pdfng.c.
  Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh91380, CSCvh91400.'
