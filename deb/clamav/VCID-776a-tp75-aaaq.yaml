summary: A vulnerability in the Portable Document Format (PDF) scanning functionality
  of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and 0.101.0 could allow an
  unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on
  an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data handling mechanisms
  within the device buffer while indexing remaining file data on an affected device.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted PDF files to an
  affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds
  read condition, resulting in a crash that could result in a denial of service condition
  on an affected device.
