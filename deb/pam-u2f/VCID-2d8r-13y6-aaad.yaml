severities: []
summary: Yubico pam-u2f before 1.1.1 has a logic issue that, depending on the pam-u2f
  configuration and the application used, could lead to a local PIN bypass. This issue
  does not allow user presence (touch) or cryptographic signature verification to
  be bypassed, so an attacker would still need to physically possess and interact
  with the YubiKey or another enrolled authenticator. If pam-u2f is configured to
  require PIN authentication, and the application using pam-u2f allows the user to
  submit NULL as the PIN, pam-u2f will attempt to perform a FIDO2 authentication without
  PIN. If this authentication is successful, the PIN requirement is bypassed.
