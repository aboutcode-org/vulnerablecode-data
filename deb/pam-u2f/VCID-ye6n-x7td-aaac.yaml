severities: []
summary: Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7 attempts parsing of the configured authfile (default
  $HOME/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys) as root (unless openasuser was enabled), and does
  not properly verify that the path lacks symlinks pointing to other files on the
  system owned by root. If the debug option is enabled in the PAM configuration, part
  of the file contents of a symlink target will be logged, possibly revealing sensitive
  information.
