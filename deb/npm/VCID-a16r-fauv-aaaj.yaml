summary: '** DISPUTED ** The npm ci command in npm 7.x and 8.x through 8.1.3 proceeds
  with an installation even if dependency information in package-lock.json differs
  from package.json. This behavior is inconsistent with the documentation, and makes
  it easier for attackers to install malware that was supposed to have been blocked
  by an exact version match requirement in package-lock.json. NOTE: The npm team believes
  this is not a vulnerability. It would require someone to socially engineer package.json
  which has different dependencies than package-lock.json. That user would have to
  have file system or write access to change dependencies. The npm team states preventing
  malicious actors from socially engineering or gaining file system access is outside
  the scope of the npm CLI.'
