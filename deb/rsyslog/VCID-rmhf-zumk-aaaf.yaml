summary: An issue was discovered in Rsyslog v8.1908.0. contrib/pmcisconames/pmcisconames.c
  has a heap overflow in the parser for Cisco log messages. The parser tries to locate
  a log message delimiter (in this case, a space or a colon), but fails to account
  for strings that do not satisfy this constraint. If the string does not match, then
  the variable lenMsg will reach the value zero and will skip the sanity check that
  detects invalid log messages. The message will then be considered valid, and the
  parser will eat up the nonexistent colon delimiter. In doing so, it will decrement
  lenMsg, a signed integer, whose value was zero and now becomes minus one. The following
  step in the parser is to shift left the contents of the message. To do this, it
  will call memmove with the right pointers to the target and destination strings,
  but the lenMsg will now be interpreted as a huge value, causing a heap overflow.
