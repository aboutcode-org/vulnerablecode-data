severities: []
summary: During RSA key generation, bignum implementations used a variation of the
  Binary Extended Euclidean Algorithm which entailed significantly input-dependent
  flow. This allowed an attacker able to perform electromagnetic-based side channel
  attacks to record traces leading to the recovery of the secret primes. *Note:* An
  unmodified Firefox browser does not generate RSA keys in normal operation and is
  not affected, but products built on top of it might. This vulnerability affects
  Firefox < 78.
