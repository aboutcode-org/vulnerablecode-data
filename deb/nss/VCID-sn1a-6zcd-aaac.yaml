summary: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.19, as used in Mozilla Firefox
  before 39.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.8 and 38.x before 38.1, Thunderbird before
  38.1, and other products, does not properly determine state transitions for the
  TLS state machine, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to defeat cryptographic
  protection mechanisms by blocking messages, as demonstrated by removing a forward-secrecy
  property by blocking a ServerKeyExchange message, aka a "SMACK SKIP-TLS" issue.
