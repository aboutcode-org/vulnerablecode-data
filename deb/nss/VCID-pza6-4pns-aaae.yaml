summary: A flaw was found in the way CHACHA20-POLY1305 was implemented in NSS in versions
  before 3.55. When using multi-part Chacha20, it could cause out-of-bounds reads.
  This issue was fixed by explicitly disabling multi-part ChaCha20 (which was not
  functioning correctly) and strictly enforcing tag length. The highest threat from
  this vulnerability is to confidentiality and system availability.
