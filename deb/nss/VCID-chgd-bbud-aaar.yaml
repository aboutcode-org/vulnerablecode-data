severities: []
summary: 'Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.12.3, Firefox before 3.0.13,
  Thunderbird before 2.0.0.23, and SeaMonkey before 1.1.18 do not properly handle
  a ''\0'' character in a domain name in the subject''s Common Name (CN) field of
  an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary
  SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.
  NOTE: this was originally reported for Firefox before 3.5.'
