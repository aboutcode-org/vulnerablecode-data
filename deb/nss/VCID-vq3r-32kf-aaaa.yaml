summary: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.15.4, as used in Mozilla
  Firefox before 27.0, Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.3, Thunderbird before 24.3, SeaMonkey
  before 2.24, and other products, does not properly restrict public values in Diffie-Hellman
  key exchanges, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass cryptographic
  protection mechanisms in ticket handling by leveraging use of a certain value.
