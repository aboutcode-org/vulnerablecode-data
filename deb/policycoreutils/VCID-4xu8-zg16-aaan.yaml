summary: Context relabeling of filesystems is vulnerable to symbolic link attack,
  allowing a local, unprivileged malicious entity to change the SELinux context of
  an arbitrary file to a context with few restrictions. This only happens when the
  relabeling process is done, usually when taking SELinux state from disabled to enable
  (permissive or enforcing). The issue was found in policycoreutils 2.5-11.
