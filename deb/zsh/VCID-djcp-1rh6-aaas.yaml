summary: zsh before 5.0.7 allows evaluation of the initial values of integer variables
  imported from the environment (instead of treating them as literal numbers). That
  could allow local privilege escalation, under some specific and atypical conditions
  where zsh is being invoked in privilege-elevation contexts when the environment
  has not been properly sanitized, such as when zsh is invoked by sudo on systems
  where "env_reset" has been disabled.
