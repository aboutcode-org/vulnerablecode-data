severities: []
summary: Zsh before version 5.4.2-test-1 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the
  shell autocomplete functionality. A local unprivileged user can create a specially
  crafted directory path which leads to code execution in the context of the user
  who tries to use autocomplete to traverse the before mentioned path. If the user
  affected is privileged, this leads to privilege escalation.
