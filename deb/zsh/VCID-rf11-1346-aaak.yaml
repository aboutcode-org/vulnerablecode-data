severities: []
summary: In Zsh before 5.8, attackers able to execute commands can regain privileges
  dropped by the --no-PRIVILEGED option. Zsh fails to overwrite the saved uid, so
  the original privileges can be restored by executing MODULE_PATH=/dir/with/module
  zmodload with a module that calls setuid().
