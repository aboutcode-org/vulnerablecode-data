summary: 'Stack-based buffer overflow in the tiffsplit command in libtiff 3.8.2 and
  earlier might might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long filename.
  NOTE: tiffsplit is not setuid. If there is not a common scenario under which tiffsplit
  is called with attacker-controlled command line arguments, then perhaps this issue
  should not be included in CVE.'
