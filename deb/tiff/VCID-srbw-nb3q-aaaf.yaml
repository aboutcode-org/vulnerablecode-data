severities: []
summary: In LibTIFF 4.0.9, there is an uncontrolled resource consumption in the TIFFSetDirectory
  function of tif_dir.c. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause
  a denial of service via a crafted tif file. This occurs because the declared number
  of directory entries is not validated against the actual number of directory entries.
