severities: []
summary: In LibTIFF 4.0.8, there is a denial of service vulnerability in the TIFFOpen
  function. A crafted input will lead to a denial of service attack. During the TIFFOpen
  process, td_imagelength is not checked. The value of td_imagelength can be directly
  controlled by an input file. In the ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip function, the
  _TIFFCheckMalloc function is called based on td_imagelength. If we set the value
  of td_imagelength close to the amount of system memory, it will hang the system
  or trigger the OOM killer.
