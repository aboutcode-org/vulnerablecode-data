severities: []
summary: LibTIFF 4.0.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
  write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TIFF image, as demonstrated
  by failure of tif_next.c to verify that the BitsPerSample value is 2, and the t2p_sample_lab_signed_to_unsigned
  function in tiff2pdf.c.
