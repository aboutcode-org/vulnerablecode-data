summary: 'Multiple buffer overflows in libtiff before 4.0.3 allow remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a crafted (1) extension block
  in a GIF image or (2) GIF raster image to tools/gif2tiff.c or (3) a long filename
  for a TIFF image to tools/rgb2ycbcr.c. NOTE: vectors 1 and 3 are disputed by Red
  Hat, which states that the input cannot exceed the allocated buffer size.'
