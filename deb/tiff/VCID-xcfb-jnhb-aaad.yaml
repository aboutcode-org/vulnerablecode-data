severities: []
summary: In LibTIFF 4.0.8, there is a heap-based buffer overflow in the t2p_write_pdf
  function in tools/tiff2pdf.c. This heap overflow could lead to different damages.
  For example, a crafted TIFF document can lead to an out-of-bounds read in TIFFCleanup,
  an invalid free in TIFFClose or t2p_free, memory corruption in t2p_readwrite_pdf_image,
  or a double free in t2p_free. Given these possibilities, it probably could cause
  arbitrary code execution.
