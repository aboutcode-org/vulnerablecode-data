severities: []
summary: Integer signedness error in the TIFFReadDirectory function in tif_dirread.c
  in libtiff 3.9.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a negative tile depth
  in a tiff image, which triggers an improper conversion between signed and unsigned
  types, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
