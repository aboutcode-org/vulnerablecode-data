summary: The default configuration for autofs 5 (autofs5) in some Linux distributions,
  such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4 and 5, does not specify the nodev mount
  option for the -hosts map, which allows local users to access "important devices"
  by operating a remote NFS server and creating special device files on that server,
  as demonstrated by the /dev/mem device.
