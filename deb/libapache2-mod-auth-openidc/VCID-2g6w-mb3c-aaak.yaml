severities: []
summary: mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache
  2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party, authenticating
  users against an OpenID Connect Provider. In versions prior to 2.4.9.4, the 3rd-party
  init SSO functionality of mod_auth_openidc was reported to be vulnerable to an open
  redirect attack by supplying a crafted URL in the `target_link_uri` parameter. A
  patch in version 2.4.9.4 made it so that the `OIDCRedirectURLsAllowed` setting must
  be applied to the `target_link_uri` parameter. There are no known workarounds aside
  from upgrading to a patched version.
