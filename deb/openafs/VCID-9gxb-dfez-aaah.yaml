severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenAFS before 1.6.23 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2.
  The backup tape controller (butc) process accepts incoming RPCs but does not require
  (or allow for) authentication of those RPCs. Handling those RPCs results in operations
  being performed with administrator credentials, including dumping/restoring volume
  contents and manipulating the backup database. For example, an unauthenticated attacker
  can replace any volume's content with arbitrary data.
