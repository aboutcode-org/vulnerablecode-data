severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenAFS before 1.6.23 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2.
  Several RPC server routines did not fully initialize their output variables before
  returning, leaking memory contents from both the stack and the heap. Because the
  OpenAFS cache manager functions as an Rx server for the AFSCB service, clients are
  also susceptible to information leakage. For example, RXAFSCB_TellMeAboutYourself
  leaks kernel memory and KAM_ListEntry leaks kaserver memory.
