severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenAFS before 1.6.23 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2.
  Several data types used as RPC input variables were implemented as unbounded array
  types, limited only by the inherent 32-bit length field to 4 GB. An unauthenticated
  attacker could send, or claim to send, large input values and consume server resources
  waiting for those inputs, denying service to other valid connections.
