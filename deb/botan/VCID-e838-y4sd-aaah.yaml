severities: []
summary: A side-channel issue was discovered in Botan before 2.9.0. An attacker capable
  of precisely measuring the time taken for ECC key generation may be able to derive
  information about the high bits of the secret key, as the function to derive the
  public point from the secret scalar uses an unblinded Montgomery ladder whose loop
  iteration count depends on the bitlength of the secret. This issue affects only
  key generation, not ECDSA signatures or ECDH key agreement.
