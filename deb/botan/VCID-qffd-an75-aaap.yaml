severities: []
summary: Botan 2.2.0 - 2.4.0 (fixed in 2.5.0) improperly handled wildcard certificates
  and could accept certain certificates as valid for hostnames when, under RFC 6125
  rules, they should not match. This only affects certificates issued to the same
  domain as the host, so to impersonate a host one must already have a wildcard certificate
  matching other hosts in the same domain. For example, b*.example.com would match
  some hostnames that do not begin with a 'b' character.
