severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in mbsync in isync 1.4.0 through 1.4.3. Due to an unchecked
  condition, a malicious or compromised IMAP server could use a crafted mail message
  that lacks headers (i.e., one that starts with an empty line) to provoke a heap
  overflow, which could conceivably be exploited for remote code execution.
