summary: A flaw was found in mbsync versions prior to 1.4.4. Due to inadequate handling
  of extremely large (>=2GiB) IMAP literals, malicious or compromised IMAP servers,
  and hypothetically even external email senders, could cause several different buffer
  overflows, which could conceivably be exploited for remote code execution.
