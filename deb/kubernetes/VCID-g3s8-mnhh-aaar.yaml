summary: A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where actors that control the
  responses of MutatingWebhookConfiguration or ValidatingWebhookConfiguration requests
  are able to redirect kube-apiserver requests to private networks of the apiserver.

  can view the redirected responses and headers in the logs.
