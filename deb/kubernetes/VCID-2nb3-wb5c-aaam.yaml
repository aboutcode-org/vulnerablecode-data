summary: The Kubernetes kubectl cp command in versions 1.1-1.12, and versions prior
  to 1.13.11, 1.14.7, and 1.15.4 allows a combination of two symlinks provided by
  tar output of a malicious container to place a file outside of the destination directory
  specified in the kubectl cp invocation. This could be used to allow an attacker
  to place a nefarious file using a symlink, outside of the destination tree.
