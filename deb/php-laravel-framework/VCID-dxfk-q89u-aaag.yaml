summary: 'In Laravel framework through 5.5.21, remote attackers can obtain sensitive
  information (such as externally usable passwords) via a direct request for the /.env
  URI. NOTE: this CVE is only about Laravel framework''s writeNewEnvironmentFileWith
  function in src/Illuminate/Foundation/Console/KeyGenerateCommand.php, which uses
  file_put_contents without restricting the .env permissions. The .env filename is
  not used exclusively by Laravel framework.'
