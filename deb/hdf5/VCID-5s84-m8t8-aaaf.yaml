severities: []
summary: The library's failure to check if certain message types support a particular
  flag, the HDF5 1.8.16 library will cast the structure to an alternative structure
  and then assign to fields that aren't supported by the message type and the library
  will write outside the bounds of the heap buffer. This can lead to code execution
  under the context of the library.
