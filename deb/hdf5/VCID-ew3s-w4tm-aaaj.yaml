summary: The HDF5 1.8.16 library allocating space for the array using a value from
  the file has an impact within the loop for initializing said array allowing a value
  within the file to modify the loop's terminator. Due to this, an aggressor can cause
  the loop's index to point outside the bounds of the array when initializing it.
