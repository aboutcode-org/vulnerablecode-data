summary: The acpi_ps_complete_final_op() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/psobject.c
  in the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the node and node_ext caches and
  causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information
  from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through
  4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.
