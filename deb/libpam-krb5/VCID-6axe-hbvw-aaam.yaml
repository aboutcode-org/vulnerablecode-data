summary: pam-krb5 before 4.9 has a buffer overflow that might cause remote code execution
  in situations involving supplemental prompting by a Kerberos library. It may overflow
  a buffer provided by the underlying Kerberos library by a single '\0' byte if an
  attacker responds to a prompt with an answer of a carefully chosen length. The effect
  may range from heap corruption to stack corruption depending on the structure of
  the underlying Kerberos library, with unknown effects but possibly including code
  execution. This code path is not used for normal authentication, but only when the
  Kerberos library does supplemental prompting, such as with PKINIT or when using
  the non-standard no_prompt PAM configuration option.
