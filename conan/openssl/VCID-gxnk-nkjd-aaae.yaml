severities: []
summary: The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead
  to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which
  have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result
  in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over
  that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses
  a DH secret across multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH
  ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites. This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is
  out of support and no longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not vulnerable
  to this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2w (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2v).
