vulnerability_id: VCID-ur7f-5ey8-aaak
aliases:
  - CVE-2022-4304
summary: 'A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which
  could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack.
  To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large
  number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes:
  PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by
  a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed
  a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages
  to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number
  of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection
  and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.'
