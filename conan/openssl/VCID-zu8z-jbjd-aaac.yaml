severities: []
summary: In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call
  the API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function
  twice. The first time, on entry, the "out" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the
  "outlen" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted
  plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call
  EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the "out" parameter.
  A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation
  of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to
  EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call.
  This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application
  a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able
  present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen
  data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents
  of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or
  causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent
  but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).
