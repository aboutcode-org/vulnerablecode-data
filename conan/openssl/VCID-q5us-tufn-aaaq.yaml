summary: Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509_verify_cert() on the client side
  to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative
  return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative
  return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL_connect()
  or SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL_get_error()
  to return the value SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY. This return value is only supposed
  to be returned by OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback().
  Since most applications do not do this the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY return value
  from SSL_get_error() will be totally unexpected and applications may not behave
  correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it
  could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses. This
  issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that
  will cause X509_verify_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate
  chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative
  Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints.
  This issue can occur even with valid chains. By combining the two issues an attacker
  could induce incorrect, application dependent behaviour. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.1
  (Affected 3.0.0).
