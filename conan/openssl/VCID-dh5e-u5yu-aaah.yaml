severities: []
summary: There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure.
  Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact
  was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered
  unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against
  RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are
  not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very
  difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private
  key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack
  would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server
  would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer
  an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1
  and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December
  2021. For the 1.0.2 release it is addressed in git commit 6fc1aaaf3 that is available
  to premium support customers only. It will be made available in 1.0.2zc when it
  is released. The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms. Fixed in OpenSSL
  3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1m (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1l). Fixed in
  OpenSSL 1.0.2zc-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zb).
