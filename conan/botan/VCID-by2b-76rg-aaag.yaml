severities: []
summary: The ElGamal implementation in Botan through 2.18.1, as used in Thunderbird
  and other products, allows plaintext recovery because, during interaction between
  two cryptographic libraries, a certain dangerous combination of the prime defined
  by the receiver's public key, the generator defined by the receiver's public key,
  and the sender's ephemeral exponents can lead to a cross-configuration attack against
  OpenPGP.
