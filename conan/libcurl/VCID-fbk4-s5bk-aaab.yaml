severities: []
summary: curl 7.63.0 to and including 7.75.0 includes vulnerability that allows a
  malicious HTTPS proxy to MITM a connection due to bad handling of TLS 1.3 session
  tickets. When using a HTTPS proxy and TLS 1.3, libcurl can confuse session tickets
  arriving from the HTTPS proxy but work as if they arrived from the remote server
  and then wrongly "short-cut" the host handshake. When confusing the tickets, a HTTPS
  proxy can trick libcurl to use the wrong session ticket resume for the host and
  thereby circumvent the server TLS certificate check and make a MITM attack to be
  possible to perform unnoticed. Note that such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to provide
  a certificate that curl will accept for the MITMed server for an attack to work
  - unless curl has been told to ignore the server certificate check.
