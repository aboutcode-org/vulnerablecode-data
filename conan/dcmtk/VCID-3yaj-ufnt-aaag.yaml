severities: []
summary: DCMTK through 3.6.6 does not handle string copy properly. Sending specific
  requests to the dcmqrdb program, it would query its database and copy the result
  even if the result is null, which can incur a head-based overflow. An attacker can
  use it to launch a DoS attack.
