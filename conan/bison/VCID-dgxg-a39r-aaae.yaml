severities: []
summary: 'GNU Bison before 3.5.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application
  crash). NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and an
  observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific compiler/architecture.
  The bug reports were intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not
  that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison.'
