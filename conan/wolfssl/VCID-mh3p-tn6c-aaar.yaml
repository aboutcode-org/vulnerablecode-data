severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 4.5.0. It mishandles the change_cipher_spec
  (CCS) message processing logic for TLS 1.3. If an attacker sends ChangeCipherSpec
  messages in a crafted way involving more than one in a row, the server becomes stuck
  in the ProcessReply() loop, i.e., a denial of service.
