summary: 'Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

  An issue was discovered in USC iLab cereal. Serialization of an (initialized) C/C++
  long double variable into a `BinaryArchive` or `PortableBinaryArchive` leaks several
  bytes of stack or heap memory, from which sensitive information (such as memory
  layout or private keys) can be gleaned if the archive is distributed outside a trusted
  context.'
