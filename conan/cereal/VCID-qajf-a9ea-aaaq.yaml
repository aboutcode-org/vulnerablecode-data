summary: 'Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference

  An issue was discovered in USC iLab cereal. It employs caching of `std::shared_ptr`
  values, using the raw pointer address as a unique identifier. This becomes problematic
  if a `std::shared_ptr variable` goes out of scope and is freed, and a new `std::shared_ptr`
  is allocated at the same address. Serialization fidelity thereby becomes dependent
  upon memory layout. In short, serialized `std::shared_ptr` variables cannot always
  be expected to serialize back into their original values. This can have any number
  of consequences, depending on the context within which this manifests.'
