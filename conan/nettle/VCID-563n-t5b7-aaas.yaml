severities: []
summary: A flaw was found in Nettle in versions before 3.7.2, where several Nettle
  signature verification functions (GOST DSA, EDDSA & ECDSA) result in the Elliptic
  Curve Cryptography point (ECC) multiply function being called with out-of-range
  scalers, possibly resulting in incorrect results. This flaw allows an attacker to
  force an invalid signature, causing an assertion failure or possible validation.
  The highest threat to this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well
  as system availability.
