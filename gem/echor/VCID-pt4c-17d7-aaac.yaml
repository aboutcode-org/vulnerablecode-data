summary: 'Arbitrary Command Execution

  The echor Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in `backplane.rb` in the `perform_request`
  function that is triggered when a semi-colon `;` is injected into a username or
  password. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to inject arbitrary commands
  if the gem is used in a RoR application.'
