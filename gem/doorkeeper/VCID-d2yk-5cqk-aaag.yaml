summary: 'access_token Disclosure CSRF

  Doorkeeper contains a flaw as HTTP requests do not require multiple steps, explicit
  confirmation, or a unique token when performing certain sensitive actions. By tricking
  a user into following a specially crafted link, a context-dependent attacker can
  perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack causing the victim to
  disclose their access_token with an arbitrary scope.'
