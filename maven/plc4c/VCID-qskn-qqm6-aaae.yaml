summary: 'Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)

  Apache PLC4X - PLC4C (Only the C language implementation was effected) was vulnerable
  to an unsigned integer underflow flaw inside the tcp transport. Users should update
  to, which addresses this issue. However, in order to exploit this vulnerability,
  a user would have to actively connect to a mallicious device which could send a
  response with invalid content. Currently we consider the probability of this being
  exploited as quite minimal, however this could change in the future, especially
  with the industrial networks growing more and more together.'
