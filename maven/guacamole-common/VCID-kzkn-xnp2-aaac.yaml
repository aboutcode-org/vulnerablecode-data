summary: 'Incorrect Default Permissions

  Apache Guacamole does not consistently restrict access to connection history based
  on user visibility. If multiple users share access to the same connection, those
  users may be able to see which other users have accessed that connection, as well
  as the IP addresses from which that connection was accessed, even if those users
  do not otherwise have permission to see other users.'
