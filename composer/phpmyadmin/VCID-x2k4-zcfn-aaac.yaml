severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in libraries/common.inc.php in phpMyAdmin 4.0 before
  4.0.10.20, 4.4.x, 4.6.x, and 4.7.0 prereleases. The restrictions caused by $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword']
  = false are bypassed under certain PHP versions (e.g., version 5). This can allow
  the login of users who have no password set even if the administrator has set $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword']
  to false (which is also the default). This occurs because some implementations of
  the PHP substr function return false when given '' as the first argument.
