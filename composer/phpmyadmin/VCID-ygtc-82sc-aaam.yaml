severities: []
summary: An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin 4.8.x before 4.8.2, in which an attacker
  can include (view and potentially execute) files on the server. The vulnerability
  comes from a portion of code where pages are redirected and loaded within phpMyAdmin,
  and an improper test for whitelisted pages. An attacker must be authenticated, except
  in the "$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] = true" case (where an attacker can specify
  any host he/she is already in control of, and execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin)
  and the "$cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0" case (which bypasses the login requirement and
  runs the vulnerable code without any authentication).
