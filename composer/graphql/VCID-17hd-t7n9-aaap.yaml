summary: 'Incorrect Default Permissions

  The automatic permission-checking mechanism in the `silverstripe/graphql` module
  does not provide complete protection against lists that are limited (e.g., through
  pagination), resulting in records that should have failed a permission check being
  added to the final result set. GraphQL endpoints are configured by default (e.g.,
  for assets), but the `admin/graphql` endpoint is access protected by default. This
  limits the vulnerability to all authenticated users, including those with limited
  permissions (e.g., where viewing records exposed through `admin/graphql` requires
  administrator permissions). However, if custom GraphQL endpoints have been configured
  for a specific implementation (usually under `/graphql`), this vulnerability could
  also be exploited through unauthenticated requests. This vulnerability only applies
  to reading records; it does not allow unauthorised changing of records.'
