summary: 'Cross-site Scripting

  An issue was discovered in Moodle. An authenticated user is allowed to add HTML
  blocks containing scripts to their Dashboard; this is normally not a security issue
  because a personal dashboard is visible to this user only. Through this security
  vulnerability, users can move such a block to other pages where they can be viewed
  by other users.'
