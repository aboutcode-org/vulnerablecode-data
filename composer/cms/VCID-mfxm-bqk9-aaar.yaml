summary: 'Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability

  It has been discovered, that it is possible to forge a link to a backend module,
  which contains a JavaScript payload. This JavaScript is executed, if an authenticated
  editor with access to the module follows the link that, is tricked to click on a
  certain HTML target. Because TYPO3 include a secret token unknown to an attacker
  in every URL, an exploit would not be feasible for these versions.'
