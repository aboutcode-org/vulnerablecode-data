summary: A vulnerability exists in CakePHP versions 4.0.x through 4.1.3. The CsrfProtectionMiddleware
  component allows method override parameters to bypass CSRF checks by changing the
  HTTP request method to an arbitrary string that is not in the list of request methods
  that CakePHP checks. Additionally, the route middleware does not verify that this
  overriden method (which can be an arbitrary string) is actually an HTTP method.
