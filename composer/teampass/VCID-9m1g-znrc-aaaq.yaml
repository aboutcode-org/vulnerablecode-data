summary: 'Improper Privilege Management

  TeamPass does not properly enforce item access control when requesting `items.queries.php`.
  It is then possible to copy any arbitrary item into a directory controlled by the
  attacker, edit any item within a read-only directory, delete an arbitrary item,
  delete the file attachments of an arbitrary item, copy the password of an arbitrary
  item to the `copy/paste` buffer, access the history of an arbitrary item, and edit
  attributes of an arbitrary directory.'
