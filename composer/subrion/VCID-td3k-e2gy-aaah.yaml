severities: []
summary: A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was discovered in Subrion
  that allows a remote attacker to remove files on the server without a victim's knowledge,
  by enticing an authenticated user to visit an attacker's web page. The application
  fails to validate the CSRF token for a GET request. An attacker can craft a `panel/uploads/read.json?cmd=rm`
  URL (removing this token) and send it to the victim.
