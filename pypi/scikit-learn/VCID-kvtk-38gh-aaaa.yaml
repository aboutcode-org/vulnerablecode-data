severities: []
summary: 'Denial of Service

  The `svm_predict_values` in `svm.cpp` in Libsvm, as used in scikit-learn and other
  products, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via
  a crafted model SVM (introduced via pickle, json, or any other model permanence
  standard) with a large value in the `_n_support` array. Note, the scikit-learn vendor''s
  position is that the behavior can only occur if the library''s API is violated by
  an application that changes a private attribute.'
